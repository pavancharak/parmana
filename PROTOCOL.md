\# Parmana Protocol



\*\*Version:\*\* 0.1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Draft



\---



\# Purpose



The Parmana Protocol defines the interoperability contract between independent Parmana implementations.



The protocol specifies how execution records, evidence, and verification artifacts are represented and exchanged.



It is independent of programming language, runtime, storage engine, and transport protocol.



\---



\# Scope



The protocol defines:



\* ExecutionTransaction format

\* Evidence format

\* Verification Report format

\* Cryptographic metadata

\* Canonical serialization

\* Version negotiation



The protocol does not define:



\* HTTP APIs

\* Databases

\* User interfaces

\* SDKs

\* Runtime implementations



\---



\# Protocol Goals



The protocol SHALL enable:



\* Independent verification

\* Cross-language interoperability

\* Deterministic serialization

\* Long-term compatibility

\* Cryptographic integrity



\---



\# Protocol Objects



The protocol defines the following canonical objects:



\* ExecutionTransaction

\* Authority

\* Intent

\* Authorization

\* Execution

\* Evidence

\* VerificationReport



\---



\# Canonical Serialization



Every protocol object SHALL have a canonical serialized representation.



Canonical serialization SHALL produce identical byte sequences for equivalent objects.



This property enables:



\* Stable hashing

\* Digital signatures

\* Replay

\* Independent verification



\---



\# Protocol Version



Each serialized artifact SHALL include:



\* Protocol Version

\* Specification Version

\* Object Type



Example:



```json

{

&#x20; "protocolVersion": "1.0",

&#x20; "specificationVersion": "0.1.0",

&#x20; "type": "ExecutionTransaction"

}

```



\---



\# Integrity



Integrity SHALL be established using pluggable cryptographic providers.



Protocol objects record metadata describing the algorithms used.



\---



\# Compatibility



Future protocol versions SHALL preserve backward readability where practical.



Breaking protocol changes require a new major protocol version.



\---



\# Transport



The protocol is transport-independent.



Implementations MAY exchange protocol objects via:



\* Files

\* HTTP

\* Message queues

\* Event streams

\* Object storage

\* Other transports



\---



\# Conformance



A conformant implementation SHALL:



\* Produce canonical protocol objects.

\* Preserve deterministic serialization.

\* Support independent verification.

\* Preserve execution trust semantics.



\---



\# Summary



The Parmana Protocol enables independent systems to exchange execution trust artifacts while preserving deterministic behavior, cryptographic integrity, and long-term interoperability.
