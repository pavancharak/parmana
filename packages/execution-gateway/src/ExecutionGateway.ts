 * recomputing the ExecutableContent hash and comparing it to
 * the authorization's businessTransactionHash (closing the

 * payload carrying the same businessTransactionId), and --
 * when a PolicyRepository is supplied -- recomputing the
 * current content hash of the policy the authorization was
 * signed under and comparing it to the authorization's own
 * signed policyContentHash, so a stale-policy authorization
 * cannot execute after the policy it relied on has changed.
 *
 * A third additive check (G-31) closes the analogous gap for
 * runtime signals rather than policy content: when a
 * SignalStateVerifier is supplied and the authorization carries a
 * signalsHash, the request's signals (`{}` when absent) are hash-checked
 * against the authorization's signed signalsHash, then independently
 * re-verified against real-world state -- so an authorization whose
 * vendor status, risk exposure, or other declared conditions have
 * since diverged cannot execute either.
 *
 * Verification order (Session 3's ordering rule: side-effect-
 * free checks first, nonce consumed last and only on success):
 *   version -> signature -> expiry -> TTL policy
 *     -> businessTransactionHash recompute-and-compare
 *     -> policyStillCurrent recompute-and-compare (required; fails closed)
 *     -> policyGovernanceVerified approval-record check (required; fails closed)
 *     -> signalsStillCurrent recompute-and-verify (when wired)
 *     -> nonce
 *
 * Stateless and deterministic: there is no pause/resume state.
 * A mismatch is a rejection naming the mismatch; a new
 * authorization is simply a new proposal through the runtime.
