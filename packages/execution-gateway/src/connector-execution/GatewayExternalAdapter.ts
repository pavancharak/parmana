 * against Parmana's public key and acts with its own. Unlike it, there
 * is no shared secret: the signature is the authentication, and its
 * audience is this endpoint's URL, so a release sent to one endpoint
 * cannot be replayed to another. It expires 60 seconds after it is
 * issued.
 *
 * Refused before anything is sent: a request with no signed
 * authorization behind it (context.release), a parameter not in the
 * registration's allowedParameters, and an endpoint whose host does not
 * resolve only to public addresses. The address is resolved here, at
 * every release, and the transport connects to that address, so a DNS
 * change after registration cannot point the release inside Parmana's
 * network. Redirects are not followed.
 *
 * The answer is accepted only when it is HTTP 200 and JSON that echoes
 * businessTransactionId and capability, with a boolean success and a
 * result object of at most 16 KB. Anything else throws, and the Gateway
 * records the outcome as unknown: the endpoint may have acted.
