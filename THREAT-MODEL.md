# Parmana threat model

This document states what Parmana protects, from whom, how, and what stays exposed. Each
threat names the control that addresses it, the evidence for that control, and the residual
risk. The evidence is one of:

- an attack scenario you can run with `npm run evaluate -- EV-xx` (see
  [evaluations/scenarios.json](evaluations/scenarios.json));
- a claim in [docs/CLAIMS.md](docs/CLAIMS.md), cited by section number.

Reviewed on 2026-10-05 against `main`. When a claim, an enforcement point or an attacker
capability changes, this file changes in the same pull request.

## 1. System and scope

**In scope:** the Parmana server in this repository: the API, the runtime that evaluates
policy and signs authorizations, the execution gateway and execution control, the built in
connectors (HubSpot, GitHub, Slack, Paytm), release to registered external connectors, policy
and approver governance, and the records it signs. Also in scope: offline verification of
those records with `@parmana/envelope-verifier`, `@parmana/crypto` and `@parmana/sign`.

**Out of scope:**

- the downstream systems themselves (Paytm, HubSpot, GitHub, Slack, an external endpoint);
- the AI agent and the model behind it;
- the hosting platform, its network and its TLS;
- the people who approve.

Parmana assumes nothing about the agent. It treats every request as possibly hostile.

**Deployments covered:**

| Development and test         | Not covered. Settings such as `PARMANA_AUTH_DISABLED=true` remove protections on purpose                                      |

## 4. Attackers

| Attacker                                                                                                                  | In scope                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| A0. Anyone on the network, with no credentials                                                                            | Yes                             |
| A1. A caller with a valid agent API key, controlling the whole request (including a prompt injected or compromised agent) | Yes                             |
| A2. An attacker who captured a valid authorization or a used approval                                                     | Yes                             |
| A3. A holder of one governance credential (maker or checker, not both)                                                    | Yes                             |
| A4. An attacker who can read or alter stored records, but holds no signing key                                            | Yes, for tampering with records |
| A5. A holder of an approver key, the signing key, the gateway key or a connector credential                               | No (assumed not compromised)    |
| A6. An attacker with write access to the database                                                                         | No (assumed)                    |
| A7. One person holding both the maker and the checker credentials                                                         | No (assumed)                    |
| A8. An agent that holds its own credentials to a downstream system and never calls Parmana                                | No (outside the boundary)       |
| A9. Anyone who controls the host, container, image, build or source that Parmana runs from                                | No (assumed)                    |

The [Audit guide](https://docs.parmanasystems.com/evaluation/audit-guide#what-an-attacker-controls)
gives the expected outcome for each of A5 to A7. In most cases the attack succeeds. They are
listed so that a review can state them as assumptions rather than leave them implicit.

A8 and A9 always succeed, and Parmana cannot prevent either. Parmana governs only actions
that are routed through it: an agent with its own credentials to a system is not governed at
all (assumptions 5 and 6 below). Whoever controls the machine, image or code Parmana runs from
can change what it enforces or skip it; T17 reduces the chance that the published code or
image was altered, but nothing in Parmana defends a host its operator, or an attacker on it,
chooses to modify. On a self hosted copy the person running it is the operator and holds A5
to A9 by construction, so a challenge against such a copy only tests attackers A0 to A4.

## 6. Assumptions

These are not defended. A review should state them as assumptions:

1. Signing keys (`default`, `gateway`) are not compromised. Under AWS KMS the key cannot be
   exported, but a process that can call `kms:Sign` can still sign.
2. Approver and step up keys are held by the people they name.
3. The maker and the checker are two people.
4. The database is not writable by an attacker.
5. Connector credentials are held only by Parmana's execution control.
6. Downstream systems accept actions only from Parmana, or verify its signed release (E5).
7. Policies are written correctly. Parmana proves which policy decided, not that it is right.
8. The host, container runtime, image and source Parmana runs from are not attacker
   controlled. Image provenance (T17) can be checked before deployment; integrity after that
   is the hosting platform's responsibility.
9. Agents reach governed systems only through Parmana: they hold no credentials of their own
   to those systems. This is a deployment property, not something Parmana enforces.

## 7. Prompt injection, specifically

Parmana does not detect prompt injection, and does not claim to. It limits what an injected
agent can achieve:

- An injected agent holds only its API key (A1). It cannot sign an approval, an authorization
  or a policy change.
- Any action whose policy needs approval is refused without a signed approval from a trusted
  person for that action and resource (EV-04). Since 2026-09-30 every agent action needs one,
  reads included (2.47).
- What the agent declares cannot authorize anything by itself (2.44). Bound signals must
  match the action executed (EV-06).
- What remains: within an approved action and resource, any parameter the approval does not
  fix is the agent's choice, and a person can be persuaded to approve a request they did not
  read closely.

## 8. How this is checked

- `npm run evaluate` runs the 16 attack scenarios behind T1 to T13 and reports each one
  blocked or not, tied to the commit.
- The full test suite and the architecture tests run on every pull request.
- [SECURITY-CHALLENGE.md](SECURITY-CHALLENGE.md) invites anyone to break T1 to T13 on a copy
  they run themselves.
- Gaps found and closed are recorded in [docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md](docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md);
  security incidents in [04-INCIDENTS-LOG.md](04-INCIDENTS-LOG.md).

The reviews so far, including four passes over the authorization path (2.25), were internal.
No independent audit has been completed. The
[Audit guide](https://docs.parmanasystems.com/evaluation/audit-guide) is the starting point for
one.
