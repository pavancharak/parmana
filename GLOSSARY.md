\# Parmana Glossary



\*\*Version:\*\* 0.1.0



\---



\# Purpose



This glossary defines the canonical terminology used throughout the Parmana Specification.



Unless explicitly stated otherwise, these definitions are normative.



\---



\# Authority



The entity responsible for initiating or approving an execution.



Authority answers the question:



> Who decided?



\---



\# Intent



The explicit description of the desired outcome.



Intent answers:



> What should happen?



\---



\# Authorization



The decision permitting or denying execution.



Authorization answers:



> Was execution allowed?



\---



\# Execution



The actual realization of the authorized intent.



Execution answers:



> What happened?



\---



\# Evidence



Immutable artifacts describing execution.



Evidence enables replay, audit, and verification.



\---



\# Verification



The independent evaluation of an execution record.



Verification answers:



> Can the recorded execution be trusted?



\---



\# Execution Trust



The architectural property established when an independent verifier can demonstrate that execution faithfully reflects authorized intent using immutable evidence.



Execution Trust is the primary objective of Parmana.



\---



\# ExecutionTransaction



The immutable aggregate root representing a single execution lifecycle.



It contains:



\* Authority

\* Intent

\* Authorization

\* Execution

\* Evidence



\---



\# Runtime



The subsystem responsible for orchestrating execution.



The Runtime produces execution records.



The Runtime does not establish trust.



\---



\# Runtime Pipeline



An ordered sequence of Runtime Components that transform an immutable `ExecutionTransaction`.



\---



\# Runtime Component



A deterministic execution stage participating in the Runtime Pipeline.



Each component accepts an immutable transaction and returns a new immutable transaction.



\---



\# Verification Engine



The subsystem responsible for independently evaluating execution records.



The Verification Engine consumes immutable transactions and produces verification reports.



\---



\# Verification Report



The immutable result produced by the Verification Engine.



A report summarizes the outcome of verification without modifying the execution record.



\---



\# Replay



The deterministic reconstruction of execution semantics using preserved execution records and evidence.



Replay is used to validate that execution can be reproduced from recorded facts.



\---



\# Deterministic Execution



Execution in which equivalent recorded inputs produce equivalent observable results.



Deterministic execution is required for replay and independent verification.



\---



\# Append-Only Evidence



An evidence model in which historical artifacts are never modified or deleted.



New information is represented by appending additional evidence rather than altering existing records.



\---



\# Cryptographic Agility



The architectural principle that cryptographic algorithms are replaceable implementation details rather than fixed domain concepts.



\---



\# Platform Guarantee



A behavior that every conformant Parmana implementation must preserve.



Examples include deterministic execution, immutable records, and independent verification.



\---



\# Conformance



The property of satisfying the Parmana Specification and Platform Guarantees.



Conformance is demonstrated through implementation behavior rather than implementation details.



\---



\# Reference Implementation



The official implementation maintained by the Parmana project.



The reference implementation demonstrates one correct realization of the specification but is not the specification itself.



\---



\# Specification



The normative set of documents that define Parmana's architecture, behavior, and contracts.



Implementations conform to the specification rather than to a particular codebase.
