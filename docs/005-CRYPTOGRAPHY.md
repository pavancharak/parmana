\# Cryptography Specification



\*\*Document:\*\* 005-CRYPTOGRAPHY.md

\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0.0 (Draft)

\*\*Status:\*\* Architecture Lock



\---



\# Purpose



This document defines the cryptographic architecture of the Parmana platform.



Cryptography protects the integrity, authenticity, and verifiability of execution evidence.



Cryptography is infrastructure.



It is not part of the business domain.



\---



\# Design Principle



Parmana depends on cryptographic properties, not cryptographic algorithms.



Algorithms may change.



Architecture must not.



\---



\# Objectives



The cryptographic layer must provide:



\* Integrity

\* Authenticity

\* Non-repudiation

\* Tamper evidence

\* Replay verification

\* Cryptographic agility



\---

```



Business domains never depend directly on specific cryptographic algorithms.



\---



\# Cryptographic Responsibilities



The cryptographic layer is responsible for:



\* Canonical serialization

\* Hash generation

\* Signature generation

\* Signature verification

\* Key identification

\* Algorithm selection



The cryptographic layer is \*\*not\*\* responsible for:



\* Authorization

\* Policy evaluation

\* Verification logic

\* Business decisions



\---



\# Canonicalization



All cryptographic operations must operate on canonical representations.



Canonicalization ensures identical input produces identical cryptographic output.



Requirements:



\* Deterministic

\* Language-independent

\* Platform-independent

\* Versioned



Canonicalization is mandatory before:



\* Hash generation

\* Signature generation

\* Verification



\---



\# Hashing



Hashes provide integrity.



Every evidence artifact may contain one or more hashes.



Each hash records:



\* Algorithm

\* Value

\* Canonicalization Version



The architecture does not mandate a specific hash algorithm.



\---



\# Digital Signatures



Signatures provide authenticity.



Every signature records:



\* Algorithm

\* Key Identifier

\* Signature Value

\* Timestamp



The architecture does not mandate a specific signature algorithm.



\---



\# Crypto Profile



Every ExecutionTransaction is associated with one Crypto Profile through its evidence.



A Crypto Profile defines:



\* Profile Identifier

\* Profile Version

\* Canonicalization Version

\* Hash Algorithm

\* Signature Algorithm

\* Key Policy



Example:



```text

Profile



enterprise-2026



Canonicalization

RFC8785-v1



Hash

SHA-256



Signature

Ed25519



Version

1.0

```



A future profile may use different algorithms while preserving the same domain model.



\---



\# Cryptographic Providers



The cryptographic layer exposes abstract providers.



\## Hash Provider



Responsibilities:



\* Generate hash

\* Verify hash



\---



\## Signature Provider



Responsibilities:



\* Sign

\* Verify



\---



\## Canonicalization Provider



Responsibilities:



\* Canonicalize data

\* Validate canonical representation



\---



\## Key Provider



Responsibilities:



\* Resolve key identifiers

\* Validate key metadata

\* Rotate keys



\---



\# Algorithm Independence



Business code must never reference specific algorithms.



Incorrect:



```text

verifyEd25519()

```



Correct:



```text

signatureProvider.verify()

```



The provider determines the appropriate implementation.



\---



\# Cryptographic Agility



Cryptographic algorithms will evolve.



The platform must support:



\* Algorithm replacement

\* Parallel algorithm support

\* Historical verification

\* Future migration



Algorithm changes must not require changes to:



\* ExecutionTransaction

\* Domain Model

\* Verification Model

\* Public API



\---



\# Hybrid Cryptography



The platform supports multiple algorithms during migration.



Example:



```text

Evidence



├── SHA-256

├── SHA3-512

├── Ed25519

└── ML-DSA

```



Verification succeeds when the configured Crypto Profile requirements are satisfied.



\---



\# Key Management



Keys are identified, never embedded.



Every signature references:



\* Key Identifier

\* Key Version



Key material remains external to the business domain.



\---



\# Replay



Historical transactions must remain verifiable.



Verification selects the appropriate Crypto Profile based on the recorded evidence.



Replay never assumes the latest algorithm.



Replay uses the algorithm originally associated with the transaction.



\---



\# Post-Quantum Readiness



The architecture is designed for cryptographic evolution.



Future algorithms may replace existing algorithms without changing:



\* Domain Model

\* ExecutionTransaction

\* Verification Engine

\* APIs

\* SDKs



Only the cryptographic providers and Crypto Profiles evolve.



\---



\# Security Principles



1\. Canonicalize before hashing.

2\. Canonicalize before signing.

3\. Never sign mutable data.

4\. Never modify signed evidence.

5\. Every cryptographic operation is versioned.

6\. Every cryptographic artifact records its algorithm.

7\. Historical evidence remains verifiable.

\# Package Structure

&#x20;   hashing/



&#x20;   signatures/



&#x20;   keys/



&#x20;   providers/



&#x20;   profiles/

```



The crypto package is the only location that contains algorithm-specific implementations.



\---



\# Dependency Rules



```text

Runtime

Evidence

&#x20;       │

Verification

&#x20;       │

Crypto Interfaces

&#x20;       │

Provider Implementations

```



Business domains depend only on cryptographic interfaces.



Provider implementations remain isolated.



\---



\# Success Criterion



The cryptographic architecture succeeds when Parmana can adopt new cryptographic algorithms, including post-quantum algorithms, without requiring changes to its domain model, execution model, verification model, public APIs, or business logic.
