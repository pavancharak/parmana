\# Storage Specification



\*\*Document:\*\* 009-STORAGE.md

\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0.0 (Draft)

\*\*Status:\*\* Implementation Specification



\---



\# Purpose



This document defines the storage architecture of the Parmana platform.



Storage preserves the complete history of trusted execution.



Storage is responsible for persistence.



Storage is not responsible for business semantics.



\---



\# Design Principles



The storage layer must satisfy the following principles.



1\. Persistence

2\. Immutability

3\. Replayability

4\. Integrity

5\. Traceability

6\. Portability

7\. Technology Independence



\---



\# Storage Philosophy



Storage exists to preserve execution history.



Business logic must never depend on a specific storage technology.



The platform depends on storage interfaces.



Storage implementations remain replaceable.



\---



\# Storage Architecture



```text

&#x20;                   Runtime

&#x20;                      │

&#x20;                      ▼

&#x20;              Storage Interfaces

&#x20;                      │

&#x20;       ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐

&#x20;       ▼              ▼              ▼

&#x20;  Relational      Object Store   Distributed

&#x20;   Database                        Ledger

```



The Runtime never depends directly on a database.



\---



\# Storage Responsibilities



Storage is responsible for:



\* Persisting ExecutionTransactions

\* Persisting Evidence

\* Persisting Verification Reports

\* Preserving history

\* Supporting replay

\* Supporting audit



Storage is \*\*not\*\* responsible for:



\* Authorization

\* Verification

\* Cryptography

\* Policy evaluation



\---



\# Storage Units



The primary storage unit is:



```text

ExecutionTransaction

```



Supporting storage units include:



```text

Evidence



VerificationReport



Metadata



ReplayArtifact

```



Storage implementations may organize these differently.



The logical model remains unchanged.



\---



\# Repository Interfaces



The platform exposes abstract repositories.



```typescript

ExecutionTransactionRepository



EvidenceRepository



VerificationRepository



MetadataRepository

```



Implementations may use:



\* PostgreSQL

\* SQLite

\* FoundationDB

\* S3-compatible storage

\* Distributed ledgers

\* Other storage systems



The Runtime depends only on repository interfaces.



\---



\# ExecutionTransaction Storage



Every ExecutionTransaction stores:



\* Transaction Identifier

\* Authority

\* Intent

\* Authorization

\* Execution

\* References to Evidence



ExecutionTransactions are immutable after completion.



Historical state is preserved.



\---



\# Evidence Storage



Evidence storage is append-only.



Evidence is never modified.



Evidence may contain:



\* Attestations

\* Receipts

\* Signals

\* Hashes

\* Signatures

\* Policy Snapshots

\* Ledger References



Evidence always references an ExecutionTransaction.



\---



\# Verification Report Storage



Verification Reports are immutable snapshots.



A transaction may have multiple Verification Reports.



Each report records:



\* Verification Specification Version

\* Verification Timestamp

\* Crypto Profile Reference

\* Verification Result



Historical reports are preserved.



\---



\# Metadata Storage



Metadata stores operational information.



Examples:



\* Labels

\* Correlation IDs

\* Tenant IDs

\* Tags

\* Retention Policies



Metadata must never change execution semantics.



\---



\# Replay Requirements



Storage must preserve enough information to reconstruct an ExecutionTransaction exactly as it existed during execution.



Replay requires:



\* Authority

\* Intent

\* Authorization

\* Execution

\* Evidence

\* Verification Specification Version

\* Crypto Profile Reference



Replay must not depend on transient runtime state.



\---



\# Immutability Rules



The following records are immutable:



\* Authority

\* Intent

\* Authorization

\* Execution

\* Evidence

\* Verification Reports



Updates create new records.



Historical records remain available.



\---



\# Retention



Retention is implementation-defined.



The architecture supports:



\* Permanent retention

\* Time-based retention

\* Regulatory retention

\* Archive storage



Retention policies must not violate replay or audit requirements.



\---



\# Backup and Recovery



Storage implementations must support:



\* Backup

\* Recovery

\* Integrity validation

\* Disaster recovery



Recovery must preserve immutability.



\---



\# Portability



Storage implementations must support migration.



Migration must preserve:



\* Transaction Identity

\* Evidence

\* Verification Reports

\* Cryptographic Metadata



Migration must not alter execution history.



\---



\# Dependency Rules



```text

Runtime

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Repository Interfaces

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Storage Implementations

```



The Runtime never imports database-specific libraries.



\---



\# Future Compatibility



The storage architecture supports:



\* Single-node deployments

\* Distributed deployments

\* Cloud-native storage

\* Multi-region replication

\* Air-gapped deployments

\* Offline verification



Storage technology may evolve without changing the Domain Model or Verification Model.



\---



\# Success Criterion



The storage architecture succeeds when every ExecutionTransaction, its associated Evidence, and all Verification Reports can be reconstructed, replayed, and independently verified regardless of the underlying storage technology used to persist them.
