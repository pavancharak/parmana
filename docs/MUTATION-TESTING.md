# Mutation testing results

`npm run mutation -- <package>` (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#mutation-testing))
makes small deliberate changes to a package's source, one at a time, and runs that package's
tests against each. A change the tests catch is **caught**; one they miss **survived**. The score
is the share caught.

This file records the first run on the five security-critical packages, what the surviving
changes showed, and what was done about them.

## How to read the scores

- **Only the package's own tests count.** Other packages' tests (the API's integration tests,
  for example) import the built package and cannot see Stryker's changes, so the real protection
  is higher than the score.
- **Some survivors change nothing observable.** An "equivalent" change, such as removing a check
  that a later check makes redundant, cannot be caught by any test. These are listed as such, not
  forced with artificial tests.
- **A low score in code that decides nothing is less urgent** than a survivor in a check that
  refuses an action. The write-up below separates the two.

## Scores

| Package             | First run | Caught       | After the fixes |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| `envelope-verifier` | 89.7%     | 104 of 116   | to be re-run    |
| `approval`          | 77.7%     | 380 of 489   | to be re-run    |
| `policy`            | 50.3%     | 659 of 1309  | to be re-run    |
| `execution-gateway` | 67.6%     | 1087 of 1607 | to be re-run    |
| `crypto`            | 65.4%\*   | 662 of 1012  | to be re-run    |

First run: 2026-10-05.

\* Measured on Node 22. The repository and CI run Node 24; on Node 22 the ML-DSA-65 and hybrid
signature tests skip themselves, so every change in those paths counted as missed. `npm run
mutation` now refuses to start below Node 24, and the re-run uses Node 24 for every package.

## What the survivors showed, and what changed

### envelope-verifier

12 survived. None let an invalid authorization through.

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A key expiring at exactly now, and a key with a future expiry, were untested        | Boundary of key expiry                | Tested: rejected at the instant, accepted a millisecond earlier |
| The maximum lifetime (`maxTtlSeconds`) boundary was untested                        | Boundary of authorization lifetime    | Tested: inclusive at the limit, refused one second over         |
| The nonce store's purge boundary was untested                                       | Memory housekeeping only              | Tested                                                          |

### approval

109 survived. The main gap was in the scope comparisons that bound what an approval covers.

| `ApprovalScopeEvaluator` (45.7%): only `eq` and `lte` were tested; `gte`, `lt`, `gt`, `between`, the boundaries and the refusal of non-number amounts were not | Yes: a policy using an untested comparator would rely on untested code        | Every comparator tested below, at and above its bound; non-numbers, malformed ranges and unknown comparators refused |
| `SignedApprovalGuard`: most field checks were never given a value of the wrong kind, and `null` was never tried where an object is required                    | Backup only: the signature check would still refuse                           | Each field tested with a wrong value                                                                                 |

### policy

650 survived, most of them in code that decides nothing at request time.

| Gap                                                                                                                                                               | Matters for security                                                                      | Done                                                                                               |

| `OperatorEvaluator` (58.9%): boundaries, and what each operator does with a value of the wrong type, were untested                                                | Yes: every rule condition is decided here                                                 | 44 tests: every operator at its boundary and against wrong types                                   |
| `PolicyEngine` (63.8%, one test in this package): `any` was untested, as were the no-match result, first match, unknown actions and missing facts                 | Yes                                                                                       | 12 tests                                                                                           |

| `FilePolicyRepository`: the character check was only tested behind the resolved-path check                                                                        | Backup layer of the path traversal guard                                                  | Names with a slash or a bare dot that stay inside the directory are now refused in a test          |
| `SignalIntentBinder`: a bound path through a string or null                                                                                                       | Yes                                                                                       | Tested                                                                                             |
| `PolicyValidator` (47.4%, 409 survivors): authoring-time validation of policy files                                                                               | Indirect: catches mistakes before approval, decides nothing at request time               | 126 tests: every refusal with its exact message, and the overlap analysis case by case             |
| `SupabasePolicyRepository` (0%, the production policy store), `FilePolicyRepository.listAll`, `PolicyRouter`'s conflict warnings, `PolicyRegistry`, error classes | Yes for the store: its name and version checks keep a request from addressing another row | Tested: name and version checks, query parameters and listing against a fake pool; the rest tested |

**Finding, now fixed:** signal types were not checked before rules ran. Each policy declares
them in `signalsSchema`, but that was only used to tell an agent what to send. A numeric signal
sent as text (`"150000"`) makes every numeric operator false, so a rule written as "reject if
amount gt X, otherwise approve" would not reject it. The shipped policies tested
(`customer-refund` 1.2.0) still refused such a request through a later rule and the approval
check, and no bypass was found. Now `PolicyEngine` refuses a request whose declared signals do
not have the declared types before any rule runs (`signal-type-violation`), and
`PolicyValidator` refuses a `signalsSchema` type other than `boolean`, `number` or `string`
([CLAIMS 2.52](CLAIMS.md), threat T18 in [THREAT-MODEL.md](../THREAT-MODEL.md)).

### execution-gateway

520 survived. The verdict itself was well tested: changing how the checks combine into a
release was caught in all but equivalent cases. The gaps were in what reaches the checks, and in
the layer between the Gateway and a connector.
