\# 016 — Platform Guarantees



\## Status



\*\*Version:\*\* 0.1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Draft



\---



\# Purpose



This document defines the guarantees provided by the Parmana platform.



These guarantees establish the expected behavior of every compliant implementation.



Unless explicitly documented otherwise, all packages SHALL preserve these guarantees.



\---



\# Guarantee 1 — Deterministic Execution



The platform SHALL produce identical outputs when presented with identical immutable inputs.



Execution SHALL NOT depend on:



\* Wall-clock time

\* Random values

\* Process identifiers

\* Thread scheduling

\* Runtime implementation details



Deterministic execution is a prerequisite for replay and verification.



\---



\# Guarantee 2 — Immutable Records



Once an ExecutionTransaction has been created, its recorded facts SHALL NOT be modified.



Changes SHALL be represented by creating new immutable objects rather than mutating existing ones.



\---



\# Guarantee 3 — Independent Verification



Verification SHALL remain independent of Runtime execution.



Verification SHALL consume immutable execution artifacts and SHALL NOT require access to Runtime internals.



\---



\# Guarantee 4 — Evidence Integrity



Evidence SHALL be append-only.



Evidence artifacts SHALL preserve their original contents once recorded.



Evidence SHALL support independent verification.



\---



\# Guarantee 5 — Cryptographic Agility



The platform SHALL NOT depend upon a single cryptographic algorithm.



Hash algorithms, signature algorithms, and key providers SHALL be replaceable without modifying the domain model.



\---



\# Guarantee 6 — Replayability



A compliant implementation SHALL support deterministic replay when sufficient execution artifacts are available.



Replay SHALL produce equivalent verification results.



\---



\# Guarantee 7 — Auditability



Every verification result SHALL be explainable using immutable evidence.



Trust SHALL be based upon recorded facts rather than implementation-specific behavior.



\---



\# Guarantee 8 — Technology Independence



Core domain concepts SHALL remain independent of:



\* Programming language

\* Database technology

\* Cloud provider

\* Runtime implementation

\* Messaging infrastructure



\---



\# Guarantee 9 — Package Independence



Each platform package SHALL have a clearly defined responsibility.



No package SHALL assume implementation details of another package beyond its published contract.



\---



\# Guarantee 10 — Forward Compatibility



The platform SHALL permit new execution stages, evidence types, verification strategies, and cryptographic providers to be introduced without requiring changes to the immutable domain model.



\---



\# Summary



Parmana provides an Execution Trust Platform whose guarantees are based on deterministic execution, immutable records, independently verifiable evidence, and technology-independent architecture.



These guarantees define the long-term contract of the platform and SHALL be preserved across future versions.
