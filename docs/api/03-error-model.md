\# Error Model v1 (Locked)



\## Status



\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Locked



\---



\# Purpose



The Parmana Error Model defines the canonical structure for all API error responses.



Every API endpoint MUST return errors using this specification.



The goals are:



\* Consistency

\* Deterministic error reporting

\* Machine readability

\* Human readability

\* Predictable client behavior



\---



\# Scope



This specification defines:



\* Error response format

\* Error categories

\* HTTP status mapping

\* Error codes

\* Error handling principles



This specification does not define:



\* Individual endpoint validation rules

\* Authentication implementation

\* Business policies



\---



\# Error Response Structure



Every error response uses the following structure.



```json

{

&#x20; "error": {

&#x20;   "code": "POLICY\_NOT\_FOUND",

&#x20;   "message": "Requested policy version does not exist."

&#x20; }

}

```



\---



\# Error Object



| Field   | Required | Description                              |

| ------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |

| code    | Yes      | Stable machine-readable error identifier |

| message | Yes      | Human-readable error description         |



Future versions may extend the object with additional fields while preserving backward compatibility.



\---



\# Error Categories



\## Validation Errors



Request structure or content is invalid.



Examples:



\* Missing required fields

\* Invalid schema

\* Invalid JSON

\* Invalid identifiers



\---



\## Authentication Errors



Caller identity cannot be established.



Examples:



\* Missing credentials

\* Invalid token

\* Expired token



\---



\## Authorization Errors



Caller lacks permission.



Examples:



\* Override not permitted

\* Policy publication denied



\---



\## Resource Errors



Requested resource cannot be resolved.



Examples:



\* Business Transaction not found

\* Execution not found

\* Policy not found

\* Receipt not found



\---



\## Conflict Errors



The request conflicts with existing immutable state.



Examples:



\* Duplicate Business Transaction with different payload

\* Override after terminal Execution

\* Immutable resource modification



\---



\## Verification Errors



Verification cannot establish trust.



Examples:



\* Receipt signature invalid

\* Policy mismatch

\* Corrupted Evidence

\* Execution Trust Record integrity failure



\---



\## Internal Errors



Unexpected platform failures.



Examples:



\* Database unavailable

\* Storage failure

\* Unexpected runtime exception



Internal implementation details must never be exposed to clients.

\# HTTP Status Mapping



| HTTP Status | Category                  | Example               |

| ----------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |

| 400         | Validation                | INVALID\_REQUEST       |

| 401         | Authentication            | UNAUTHENTICATED       |

| 403         | Authorization             | FORBIDDEN             |

| 404         | Resource                  | POLICY\_NOT\_FOUND      |

| 409         | Conflict                  | DUPLICATE\_TRANSACTION |

| 422         | Verification / Validation | VERIFICATION\_FAILED   |

| 500         | Internal                  | INTERNAL\_ERROR        |

\# Error Handling Rules



\## Rule 1



Every error response SHALL include both:



\* code

\* message



\---



\## Rule 2



Error codes are stable.



They are part of the public API contract and must not change between minor versions.



\---



\## Rule 3



Messages are intended for humans.



Clients should rely on the error code for programmatic behavior.



\---



\## Rule 4



Internal implementation details must never be exposed.



\---



\## Rule 5



Failed requests never partially modify immutable resources.



Either the request succeeds or no state change occurs.



\---



\# Relationship to Business Transactions



Business Transaction creation is atomic.



If any validation step fails:



\* No Business Transaction is created.

\* No Execution Trust Record is created.

\* No partial state is persisted.



\---



\# Relationship to Verification



Verification failures indicate that trust could not be established.



They do not modify the Execution Trust Record.



Verification results remain append-only.



\---



\# Canonical Principles



\## Principle 1



Every error uses the canonical Error Response structure.



\---



\## Principle 2



Error codes are stable and machine-readable.



\---



\## Principle 3



Messages are human-readable.



\---



\## Principle 4



Errors never expose internal implementation details.



\---



\## Principle 5



Failed operations preserve deterministic system state.



\---



\## Principle 6



Business Transactions are created atomically.



\---



\## Principle 7



Error semantics are consistent across all Parmana APIs.

\# Summary



The Parmana Error Model provides a deterministic and uniform mechanism for reporting API failures.



By standardizing error structures, stable error codes, HTTP status mappings, and error-handling principles, Parmana enables predictable client behavior, simplifies SDK development, and ensures that failures never compromise the integrity or immutability of Business Transactions or Execution Trust Records.
