\# API Overview v1 (Locked)



\## Status



\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Locked



\---



\# Purpose



The Parmana API provides a resource-oriented interface for creating, executing, verifying, and auditing Business Transactions.



The API is built around a single primary resource:



> \*\*Business Transaction\*\*



All other resources are owned by a Business Transaction.



The API exposes the complete lifecycle of a Business Transaction while preserving deterministic execution, replay, verification, and auditability.



\---



\# API Principles



\## Principle 1



The Business Transaction is the primary API resource.



\---



\## Principle 2



All subordinate resources belong to a Business Transaction.



\---



\## Principle 3



Resources are immutable unless explicitly defined otherwise.



\---



\## Principle 4



Historical artifacts are append-only.



\---



\## Principle 5



Every Business Transaction owns exactly one Execution Trust Record.



\---



\## Principle 6



The API is deterministic.



Identical Business Transactions evaluated under the same recorded Policy always produce the same trust artifacts.



\---



\# Resource Model



```text

Business Transaction



├── Executions



├── Override



├── Verification History



├── Receipt



└── Trust Chain

```



The Execution Trust Record is the canonical internal trust object.



The Trust Chain is a representation of that record.



\---



\# Primary Resource



\## Business Transaction



Represents a single business operation submitted by a calling application.



Examples:



\* Payment approval

\* Loan approval

\* Insurance claim

\* Customer onboarding



Every Business Transaction is uniquely identified by:



```text

businessTransactionId

```



\---



\# Child Resources



\## Executions



Represent attempts to execute the Business Transaction.



A Business Transaction may have:



\* Zero Executions

\* One Execution

\* Multiple Executions



\---



\## Override



Represents a human-authorized exception to a rejected Decision.



Overrides never replace the original Decision.



\---



\## Verification History



Records every Verification event performed against the Execution Trust Record.



Verification history is append-only.



\---



\## Receipt



A portable, cryptographically verifiable artifact derived from an Execution.



Each Execution has exactly one Receipt.



\---



\## Trust Chain



A navigable representation of the Execution Trust Record.



Used for:



\* Audit

\* Investigation

\* Visualization

\* Independent inspection



\---



\# API Groups



The API is organized into the following resource groups.



\## Business Transactions



Create and retrieve Business Transactions.



\---



\## Executions



Create and retrieve Execution resources.



\---



\## Overrides



Create and retrieve Overrides.



\---



\## Verification



Verify the integrity of a Business Transaction.



\---



\## Receipts



Retrieve cryptographically signed Receipts.



\---



\## Trust Chain



Retrieve the complete trust relationship for a Business Transaction.



\---



\## Policies



Discover available Policies.



\---



\## System



Operational endpoints.



Examples:



\* Health

\* Version



\---



\# API Resource Hierarchy



```text

/transactions



/transactions/{businessTransactionId}



/transactions/{businessTransactionId}/executions



/transactions/{businessTransactionId}/override



/transactions/{businessTransactionId}/verify



/transactions/{businessTransactionId}/receipt



/transactions/{businessTransactionId}/trust-chain



/policies



/health



/version

```

\# API Workflow



A typical Business Transaction progresses through the following sequence.



```text

Create Business Transaction



↓



Policy Resolution



↓



Decision



↓



Override (Optional)



↓



Execution



↓



Receipt



↓



Verification



↓



Trust Chain

```



\---



\# Design Goals



The Parmana API is designed to provide:



\* Deterministic policy evaluation.

\* Immutable execution records.

\* Cryptographic trust artifacts.

\* Independent verification.

\* Deterministic replay.

\* Complete auditability.



\---



\# Canonical Principles



\## Principle 1



Business Transaction is the primary API resource.



\---



\## Principle 2



All API resources are transaction-scoped.



\---



\## Principle 3



The Execution Trust Record is the canonical trust object.



\---



\## Principle 4



The Trust Chain is a representation of the Execution Trust Record.



\---



\## Principle 5



Receipts provide portable cryptographic proof.



\---



\## Principle 6



Verification validates trust artifacts without modifying them.



\---



\## Principle 7



The API is resource-oriented, deterministic, and append-only.



\---



\# Summary



The Parmana API exposes the complete lifecycle of a Business Transaction through a resource-oriented interface.



By centering the API on immutable Business Transactions and append-only trust artifacts, Parmana enables deterministic execution, replay, verification, and long-term auditability while maintaining a clear separation between business resources and platform infrastructure.
