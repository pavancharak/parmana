\# 014 — Execution Trust Model



\## Status



\*\*Version:\*\* 0.1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Draft



\---



\# Purpose



The Execution Trust Model defines the trust guarantees provided by Parmana.



It establishes how authority, intent, authorization, execution, evidence, and verification combine to produce independently verifiable execution.



Execution Trust is the primary architectural principle of Parmana.



\---



\# Trust Statement



Parmana ensures there is no gap between what humans decide and what AI systems do.



Execution Trust is established when an independent verifier can demonstrate that:



\* the correct authority initiated the transaction,

\* the intended action was clearly defined,

\* authorization permitted execution,

\* execution faithfully followed the authorized intent,

\* sufficient immutable evidence exists, and

\* the resulting transaction has not been modified.



\---



\# Trust Chain



Execution Trust is established through the following chain.



```text

Authority

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Intent

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Authorization

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Execution

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Evidence

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Verification

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Trust

```



Every stage depends on the integrity of the previous stage.

\# Trust Components



\## Authority



Defines who is permitted to initiate execution.



Questions answered:



\* Who decided?

\* Is the authority identifiable?



\---



\## Intent



Defines what should happen.



Questions answered:



\* What was supposed to happen?

\* Was the intent complete?



\---



\## Authorization



Defines whether execution was permitted.



Questions answered:



\* Was execution allowed?

\* Which authorization decision applied?



\---



\## Execution



Defines what actually happened.



Questions answered:



\* What occurred?

\* Did execution complete?



\---



\## Evidence



Provides immutable facts describing execution.



Questions answered:



\* What evidence exists?

\* Can execution be reconstructed?



\---



\## Verification



Evaluates all recorded facts independently.



Questions answered:



\* Can trust be established?

\* Does execution satisfy the trust model?



\---



\# Trust Principles



Every compliant implementation SHALL satisfy the following principles.



\## Determinism



Identical transactions produce identical verification results.



\---



\## Immutability



Recorded facts are never modified.



\---



\## Verifiability



Trust is established through evidence rather than assertion.



\---



\## Independence



Verification is independent of Runtime.



\---



\## Replayability



Execution can be replayed using immutable artifacts.



\---



\## Auditability



Every trust decision is supported by evidence.



\---

\# Trust Boundaries



The Runtime creates execution records.



The Verification Engine establishes trust.



The Cryptography package establishes integrity.



The Storage package preserves artifacts.



Each component is independently replaceable.



\---



\# Architectural Invariant



Execution Trust is achieved only when all of the following are true:



\* Authority is valid.

\* Intent is complete.

\* Authorization permits execution.

\* Execution matches intent.

\* Evidence is sufficient.

\* Integrity is preserved.

\* Verification succeeds.



Failure of any invariant prevents trust from being established.



\---



\# Summary



Execution Trust is not a feature.



Execution Trust is the architectural property that emerges when immutable execution records can be independently verified using deterministic evidence.
