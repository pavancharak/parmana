\# Execution Transaction Specification



\*\*Document:\*\* 003-EXECUTION-TRANSACTION.md

\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0.0 (Draft)

\*\*Status:\*\* Architecture Lock



\---



\# Purpose



ExecutionTransaction is the root aggregate of the Parmana platform.



It represents one complete trusted execution lifecycle.



Every execution processed by Parmana is represented by exactly one ExecutionTransaction.



All domain objects, evidence, and verification artifacts belong to a single ExecutionTransaction.



\---



\# Definition



An ExecutionTransaction represents the complete lifecycle required to independently verify that execution matched authorized intent.



It is the smallest unit of trust within the platform.



\---



\# Aggregate Structure



```text

ExecutionTransaction

│

├── Metadata

├── Authority

├── Intent

├── Authorization

├── Execution

├── Evidence

└── Verification

```



No object exists outside an ExecutionTransaction.



\---



\# Responsibilities



ExecutionTransaction is responsible for:



\* establishing aggregate boundaries

\* maintaining lifecycle consistency

\* preserving immutable relationships

\* providing a stable execution identity

\* enabling independent verification



ExecutionTransaction is \*\*not\*\* responsible for:



\* policy evaluation

\* cryptographic operations

\* execution logic

\* verification algorithms



Those responsibilities belong to their respective domains.



\---



\# Identity



Every ExecutionTransaction must have a globally unique identifier.



Example:



```text

txn\_01J9QZ9P2F7J3A8N6T4K5M8R1

```



The identifier never changes.



\---



\# Lifecycle



Every ExecutionTransaction follows the same lifecycle.



```text

Created

&#x20;   │

&#x20;   ▼

Authorized

&#x20;   │

&#x20;   ▼

Executed

&#x20;   │

&#x20;   ▼

Evidence Recorded

&#x20;   │

&#x20;   ▼

Verified

```



Lifecycle stages are append-only.



A transaction never moves backward.



\---



\# Components



\## Metadata



Contains descriptive information about the transaction.



Example fields:



\* transactionId

\* createdAt

\* updatedAt

\* status

\* tenantId

\* correlationId

\* labels



Metadata does not participate in authorization or verification logic.



\---



\## Authority



Represents who has authority to authorize execution.



Exactly one Authority is associated with an ExecutionTransaction.



Authority cannot be changed after transaction creation.



\---



\## Intent



Represents the expected execution.



Intent defines:



\* action

\* parameters

\* expected outcome

\* policy reference



Intent is immutable.



\---



\## Authorization



Represents permission to execute the intent.



Authorization records:



\* authorization result

\* policy snapshot

\* decision metadata

\* authorization timestamp



Authorization is produced before execution.



\---



\## Execution



Represents what actually occurred.



Execution records:



\* execution system

\* execution status

\* execution reference

\* execution timestamp



Execution is immutable.



\---



\## Evidence



Represents every artifact required for independent verification.



Evidence may include:



\* Signals

\* Attestations

\* Receipts

\* Signatures

\* Hashes

\* Ledger Records



Evidence is append-only.



Evidence is never modified.



\---



\## Verification



Represents the verification outcome.



Verification records:



\* verification status

\* invariant results

\* trust report

\* verification timestamp



Verification never modifies execution.



Verification observes execution.



\---



\# Aggregate Rules



ExecutionTransaction owns:



\* Authority

\* Intent

\* Authorization

\* Execution

\* Evidence

\* Verification



No object may belong to multiple transactions.



No cross-transaction references are permitted.



\---



\# State Machine



```text

NEW

&#x20;│

&#x20;▼

AUTHORIZED

&#x20;│

&#x20;▼

EXECUTED

&#x20;│

&#x20;▼

EVIDENCE\_RECORDED

&#x20;│

&#x20;▼

VERIFIED

```



Additional terminal states may include:



\* FAILED

\* CANCELLED

\* EXPIRED



Historical states are preserved.



\---



\# Invariants



Every ExecutionTransaction must satisfy the following invariants.



\## Authority



A valid authority exists.



\---



\## Intent



Intent is immutable.



\---



\## Authorization



Execution is authorized before execution begins.



\---



\## Execution



Execution references exactly one authorization.



\---



\## Evidence



Evidence preserves every execution artifact.



\---



\## Verification



Verification is reproducible from recorded evidence.



\---



\# Immutability Rules



The following objects are immutable once created:



\* Authority

\* Intent

\* Authorization

\* Execution

\* Verification Result



Evidence is append-only.



Metadata may be extended but historical values must remain traceable.



\---



\# Relationships



```text

ExecutionTransaction

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ├── owns Authority

&#x20;       ├── owns Intent

&#x20;       ├── owns Authorization

&#x20;       ├── owns Execution

&#x20;       ├── owns Evidence

&#x20;       └── owns Verification

```



Ownership never changes.



\---



\# Transaction Completion



An ExecutionTransaction is considered complete when:



\* execution has occurred

\* evidence has been recorded

\* verification has completed



Completion does not imply success.



Verification may return:



\* PASS

\* FAIL

\* INCOMPLETE

\* UNKNOWN



\---



\# Architectural Constraints



ExecutionTransaction:



\* is the only aggregate root

\* owns the execution lifecycle

\* never embeds implementation-specific services

\* never embeds cryptographic algorithms

\* never depends on infrastructure implementations



Infrastructure depends on the aggregate.



The aggregate never depends on infrastructure.



\---



\# Future Compatibility



ExecutionTransaction is designed to remain stable across:



\* new execution engines

\* AI agents

\* human workflows

\* robotic systems

\* distributed runtimes

\* cryptographic upgrades

\* post-quantum cryptography



Changes in implementation must not require changes to the aggregate model.



\---



\# Success Criterion



An ExecutionTransaction succeeds as the platform's root aggregate when an independent verifier can reconstruct the complete execution lifecycle, evaluate every invariant, and determine whether execution matched authorized intent using only the transaction's recorded data and evidence.
