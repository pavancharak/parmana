\# 015 — Platform Architecture



\## Status



\*\*Version:\*\* 0.1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Draft



\---



\# Purpose



This document defines the logical architecture of the Parmana platform.



It describes the major platform components, their responsibilities, and the boundaries between them.



This document is normative.



\---



\# Platform Overview



Parmana is an Execution Trust Platform.



It establishes a verifiable trust chain between:



\* Authority

\* Intent

\* Authorization

\* Execution

\* Evidence

\* Verification



The platform is organized as a set of independent packages that collaborate through immutable domain models.

\# Core Package



The Core package defines the canonical domain model.



Responsibilities:



\* Domain entities

\* Value objects

\* Aggregate roots

\* Shared types



The Core package contains no business execution logic.



\---



\# Runtime Package



The Runtime orchestrates execution.



Responsibilities:



\* Runtime pipeline

\* Stage orchestration

\* Transaction lifecycle



The Runtime does not perform verification.



\---



\# Verification Package



The Verification package independently evaluates completed transactions.



Responsibilities:



\* Verification pipeline

\* Trust evaluation

\* Verification reports



The Verification package never executes transactions.



\---



\# Evidence Package



The Evidence package manages immutable execution artifacts.



Responsibilities:



\* Evidence artifacts

\* Evidence collections

\* Evidence serialization



\---



\# Cryptography Package



The Cryptography package provides integrity services.



Responsibilities:



\* Hashing

\* Signatures

\* Integrity verification

\* Cryptographic providers



Cryptographic algorithms remain replaceable.



\---



\# Storage Package



The Storage package persists immutable artifacts.



Responsibilities:



\* Transaction persistence

\* Evidence persistence

\* Verification persistence



Storage implementations remain independent of the Runtime.



\---



\# SDK Package



The SDK provides the public developer API.



Responsibilities:



\* Client APIs

\* Builders

\* Convenience abstractions



The SDK hides internal implementation details.



\---



\# API Package



The API exposes Parmana over HTTP.



Responsibilities:



\* REST endpoints

\* Request validation

\* Response serialization



The API delegates execution to the Runtime.



\---



\# CLI Package



The CLI provides command-line access to the platform.



Responsibilities:



\* Local execution

\* Verification

\* Diagnostics

\* Administration



\---



\# Dependency Rules



Dependencies flow inward.

```



Core has no dependency on higher-level packages.



Verification never depends on Runtime internals.



Runtime never depends on Verification.



\---



\# Architectural Principles



The platform is governed by the following principles:



\* Immutability

\* Determinism

\* Independent verification

\* Separation of concerns

\* Replaceable implementations

\* Technology independence



\---



\# Summary



Parmana is organized as a layered execution trust platform.



Each package has a single responsibility.



Together, they provide deterministic execution, immutable evidence, and independently verifiable trust.
