\# Runtime Specification



\*\*Document:\*\* 011-RUNTIME.md

\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0.0 (Draft)

\*\*Status:\*\* Implementation Specification



\---



\# Purpose



This document defines the Runtime architecture of the Parmana platform.



The Runtime coordinates trusted execution.



The Runtime is responsible for orchestrating the execution lifecycle and producing immutable evidence.



The Runtime does not establish trust.



Execution Trust is established independently by the Verification Engine.



\---



\# Runtime Philosophy



The Runtime performs work.



The Runtime records facts.



The Runtime never determines whether those facts should be trusted.



That responsibility belongs exclusively to Verification.



\---



\# Design Principles



The Runtime must be:



\* Deterministic

\* Observable

\* Composable

\* Technology Independent

\* Event Driven

\* Idempotent where applicable

\* Evidence Producing



\---

```



Verification begins only after Runtime completes.



\---



\# Runtime Responsibilities



The Runtime is responsible for:



\* Creating ExecutionTransactions

\* Recording Authority

\* Recording Intent

\* Evaluating Authorization

\* Coordinating Execution

\* Producing Evidence

\* Emitting Domain Events



The Runtime is \*\*not\*\* responsible for:



\* Verification

\* Trust Reports

\* Replay

\* Cryptographic policy decisions

\* Audit conclusions



\---



\# Runtime Domains



The Runtime consists of four canonical domains.



```text id="kkyovj"

Authority



Intent



Authorization



Execution

```



Each domain has one responsibility.



\---



\# Runtime Components



\## Authority



Captures who is permitted to authorize execution.



Produces:



\* Authority Record



\---



\## Intent



Captures what execution is expected to perform.



Produces:



\* Intent Record



Intent is immutable.



\---



\## Authorization



Evaluates execution policy.



Produces:



\* Authorization Result

\* Decision Record

\* Policy Snapshot

\* Execution Permit



Authorization completes before execution begins.



\---



\## Execution



Coordinates execution.



Produces:



\* Execution Record

\* Execution Status

\* Execution Metadata



Execution produces Evidence.



Execution does not perform Verification.



\---



\# Runtime State Machine



```text id="mjlwmw"

&#x20;│

&#x20;▼

AUTHORITY\_RECORDED

&#x20;│

&#x20;▼

INTENT\_RECORDED

&#x20;│

&#x20;▼

AUTHORIZED

&#x20;│

&#x20;▼

EXECUTING

&#x20;│

&#x20;▼

EXECUTED

&#x20;│

&#x20;▼

EVIDENCE\_RECORDED

&#x20;│

&#x20;▼

COMPLETED

```



Terminal states:



\* FAILED

\* CANCELLED

\* EXPIRED



Historical states are preserved.



\---



\# Runtime Events



The Runtime emits immutable domain events.



Examples:



```text id="a4k7fy"

transaction.created



authority.recorded



intent.recorded



authorization.completed



execution.started



execution.completed



evidence.generated

```



Events are append-only.



Events are never modified.



\---



\# Runtime Boundaries



The Runtime depends on:



\* Domain Model

\* Storage Interfaces

\* Crypto Interfaces

\* Event Interfaces



The Runtime does not depend on:



\* Verification Engine

\* Replay Engine

\* Trust Reports

\* User Interfaces



This preserves separation of concerns.



\---



\# Runtime Interfaces



The Runtime exposes abstract services.



Examples:



```text id="0d9hng"

ExecutionCoordinator



AuthorizationService



ExecutionService



EvidenceService



EventPublisher

```



Implementations remain replaceable.



\---



\# Runtime Outputs



The Runtime produces:



\* ExecutionTransaction

\* Evidence

\* Domain Events



The Runtime never produces:



\* Verification Results

\* Trust Reports

\* Audit Decisions



\---



\# Error Handling



Runtime failures produce immutable failure records.



Failures never delete historical information.



Examples:



\* Authorization Failed

\* Execution Failed

\* Timeout

\* External System Failure



Failure records become part of the ExecutionTransaction history.



\---



\# Scalability



The Runtime supports:



\* Synchronous execution

\* Asynchronous execution

\* Event-driven execution

\* Distributed execution

\* Human-in-the-loop execution

\* AI agent execution

\* Batch execution



The execution model remains unchanged.



\---



\# Dependency Model



```text id="zgwmvr"

Application

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Runtime

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ├── Storage

&#x20;     ├── Crypto

&#x20;     ├── Events

&#x20;     └── External Systems



Verification



↓



Consumes Runtime Outputs

```



Runtime never calls Verification.



Verification observes Runtime outputs.



\---



\# Future Compatibility



The Runtime architecture supports:



\* AI agents

\* Human operators

\* Robotic systems

\* Microservices

\* Serverless platforms

\* Edge computing

\* Future execution engines



Execution technologies may evolve without changing the Runtime model.



\---



\# Success Criterion



The Runtime succeeds when it consistently produces a complete, immutable ExecutionTransaction, associated Evidence, and Domain Events that are sufficient for an independent Verification Engine to determine whether execution matched authorized intent without requiring access to the Runtime itself.
