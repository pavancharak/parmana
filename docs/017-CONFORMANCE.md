\# 017 — Conformance Specification



\## Status



\*\*Version:\*\* 0.1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Draft



\---



\# Purpose



This document defines the minimum requirements for a software implementation to be considered conformant with the Parmana specification.



Conformance enables interoperability, predictable behavior, and independent verification across implementations.



\---



\# Scope



This specification applies to all official and third-party implementations of Parmana, including:



\* Core libraries

\* Runtime implementations

\* Verification engines

\* SDKs

\* APIs

\* Command-line tools



\---



\# Conformance Levels



\## Level 1 — Core



A conformant Core implementation SHALL:



\* Implement the canonical domain model.

\* Preserve immutability of domain objects.

\* Support deterministic serialization.

\* Produce stable identifiers.

\* Implement the canonical `ExecutionTransaction`.



\---



\## Level 2 — Runtime



A conformant Runtime implementation SHALL:



\* Execute transactions through a deterministic pipeline.

\* Preserve transaction immutability.

\* Produce evidence compatible with the Core specification.

\* Avoid modifying completed transactions.



\---



\## Level 3 — Verification



A conformant Verification implementation SHALL:



\* Evaluate Authority.

\* Evaluate Intent.

\* Evaluate Authorization.

\* Evaluate Execution.

\* Evaluate Evidence.

\* Evaluate Integrity.

\* Produce deterministic verification reports.



\---



\## Level 4 — Platform



A conformant Platform implementation SHALL satisfy every guarantee defined in:



\* 014 — Execution Trust Model

\* 016 — Platform Guarantees



\---



\# Required Behaviors



Implementations SHALL:



\* Preserve deterministic behavior.

\* Preserve immutable execution records.

\* Support independent verification.

\* Maintain package boundaries.

\* Avoid hidden side effects.



\---



\# Prohibited Behaviors



Implementations SHALL NOT:



\* Mutate immutable domain objects.

\* Couple Verification to Runtime internals.

\* Couple Core to infrastructure.

\* Depend on implementation-specific serialization.

\* Modify recorded evidence.



\---



\# Version Compatibility



Each implementation SHALL declare:



\* Specification version

\* Package version

\* Supported feature set



Example:



Specification: 0.1.0



Core: 0.1.0



Runtime: 0.1.0



Verification: 0.1.0



\---



\# Conformance Testing



Implementations SHOULD provide automated conformance tests covering:



\* Domain model

\* Runtime pipeline

\* Evidence generation

\* Verification

\* Serialization

\* Replay

\* Integrity



Passing conformance tests indicates behavioral compatibility with the Parmana specification.



\---



\# Future Extensions



Future specification versions MAY introduce:



\* Additional runtime stages

\* New evidence artifact types

\* Additional verification strategies

\* New cryptographic providers



Extensions SHALL NOT invalidate existing conformant implementations unless explicitly defined by a major specification version.



\---



\# Summary



Conformance ensures that independent implementations of Parmana exhibit the same observable behavior, enabling trustworthy execution, replay, and verification across environments.
