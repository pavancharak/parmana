\# Parmana Constitution



\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0.0 (Draft)

\*\*Status:\*\* Architecture Lock

\*\*Applies To:\*\* Entire Parmana Platform



\---



\# Purpose



Parmana is \*\*Execution Trust Infrastructure\*\*.



Its purpose is to establish a verifiable chain from authority to execution, enabling independent verification that every execution matched its authorized intent.



Parmana does not ask users to trust the platform.



Parmana produces verifiable evidence that allows trust to be independently established.



\---



\# Mission



Ensure there is no gap between what is authorized and what is executed.



\---



\# Core Question



Every feature in Parmana must strengthen the answer to one question:



> \*\*Can this execution be independently verified to match its authorized intent?\*\*



If a feature does not improve the answer to this question, it does not belong in the core platform.



\---



\# Canonical Lifecycle



Every execution follows the same lifecycle.



```

Authority

&#x20;   ↓

Intent

&#x20;   ↓

Authorization

&#x20;   ↓

Execution

&#x20;   ↓

Evidence

&#x20;   ↓

Verification

&#x20;   ↓

Execution Trust

```



This lifecycle is immutable.



\---



\# Platform Pillars



Parmana consists of three platform pillars.



\## Runtime



Responsible for creating trusted execution.



Domains:



\* Authority

\* Intent

\* Authorization

\* Execution



\---



\## Evidence



Responsible for preserving immutable execution evidence.



Artifacts may include:



\* Attestations

\* Receipts

\* Signatures

\* Hashes

\* Ledger Records

\* Signals



\---



\## Verification



Responsible for independently verifying execution.



Outputs include:



\* Verification Results

\* Trust Reports

\* Replay

\* Integrity Checks



\---



\# Root Aggregate



The root aggregate of the platform is:



```

ExecutionTransaction

```



Every execution belongs to exactly one ExecutionTransaction.



Every artifact must reference an ExecutionTransaction either directly or indirectly.



\---



\# Canonical Domains



The following domains are permanent.



\* Authority

\* Intent

\* Authorization

\* Execution

\* Evidence

\* Verification



Implementation artifacts are not top-level domains.



Examples include:



\* Decision

\* Receipt

\* Attestation

\* Token

\* Signature

\* Hash



These belong inside the appropriate canonical domain.



\---



\# Architectural Principles



\## 1. Execution is the Unit of Trust



Execution—not requests, workflows, or decisions—is the primary unit of trust.



\---



\## 2. Intent is Immutable



Intent cannot change once authorization begins.



Changes require a new ExecutionTransaction.



\---



\## 3. Evidence is Append-Only



Evidence is never modified.



Corrections create new evidence.



Historical evidence is preserved.



\---



\## 4. Verification is Deterministic



Verification must produce identical results when replayed using the same evidence and policies.



\---



\## 5. Verification is Independent



Verification must not rely solely on runtime claims.



Verification operates on recorded evidence.



\---



\## 6. Trust is an Outcome



Trust is not stored.



Trust is established through successful verification.



\---



\## 7. Cryptography is Replaceable



Cryptographic algorithms are implementation details.



The platform architecture must remain unchanged as cryptographic algorithms evolve.



\---



\# Cryptographic Agility



Every cryptographic operation must be versioned.



Every artifact must record:



\* Hash Algorithm

\* Signature Algorithm

\* Key Identifier

\* Crypto Profile



Historical artifacts must remain verifiable after future cryptographic migrations.



\---



\# Repository Rule



Capabilities migrate.



Implementations do not.



The platform evolves by preserving capabilities while allowing implementations to change.



\---



\# Public API Principle



Public APIs expose business concepts.



Examples:



\* Execution

\* Evidence

\* Verification

\* Trust Report



Implementation details remain internal.



\---



\# Verification Principle



Verification answers only one question:



> \*\*Did execution match authorized intent?\*\*



Everything else exists to support this answer.



\---



\# Evolution Policy



New capabilities may be added.



Existing implementation may evolve.



The following concepts require an explicit architecture decision before modification:



\* ExecutionTransaction

\* Authority

\* Intent

\* Authorization

\* Execution

\* Evidence

\* Verification

\* Runtime

\* Evidence Platform

\* Verification Platform



These concepts define the architectural identity of Parmana.



\---



\# Success Criterion



Parmana succeeds when an independent verifier can determine, using recorded evidence alone, whether execution matched authorized intent.
