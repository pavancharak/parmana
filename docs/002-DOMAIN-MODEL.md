\# Parmana Domain Model



\*\*Document:\*\* 002-DOMAIN-MODEL.md

\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0.0 (Draft)

\*\*Status:\*\* Architecture Lock



\---



\# Purpose



This document defines the canonical domain model of the Parmana platform.



The domain model establishes the vocabulary, ownership, relationships, and responsibilities of every core concept in the platform.



Only the concepts defined in this document are considered first-class domain objects.



\---



\# Domain Philosophy



Parmana models \*\*trusted execution\*\*.



The platform does not model workflows.



The platform does not model applications.



The platform models the lifecycle of a single execution and the evidence required to independently verify that execution.



\---



\# Root Aggregate



The root aggregate is:



```text

ExecutionTransaction

```



Every domain object belongs to exactly one ExecutionTransaction.



Nothing exists outside an ExecutionTransaction.



\---



\# Aggregate Structure



```text

ExecutionTransaction

│

├── Authority

├── Intent

├── Authorization

├── Execution

├── Evidence

└── Verification

```



This structure is permanent.



\---

\* Verify Evidence

\* Produce Trust Report



\### Outputs



\* PASS

\* FAIL

\* INCOMPLETE

\* UNKNOWN



\### Invariants



\* Verification is deterministic.

\* Verification is reproducible.

\* Verification depends on recorded evidence.



\---



\## 8. CryptoProfile



\### Purpose



Defines the cryptographic configuration used by an ExecutionTransaction.



\### Components



\* Canonicalization

\* Hash Algorithm

\* Signature Algorithm

\* Key Identifier

\* Version



\### Responsibilities



\* Enable cryptographic agility.

\* Preserve historical verification.



\### Invariants



\* CryptoProfile is immutable.

\* Every signature references one CryptoProfile.

\# Ownership Rules



| Object        | Owner                |

| ------------- | -------------------- |

| Authority     | ExecutionTransaction |

| Intent        | ExecutionTransaction |

| Authorization | ExecutionTransaction |

| Execution     | ExecutionTransaction |

| Evidence      | ExecutionTransaction |

| Verification  | ExecutionTransaction |

| CryptoProfile | ExecutionTransaction |



No domain object may be shared between ExecutionTransactions.



\---



\# Domain Boundaries



Implementation artifacts belong to domains.



They are \*\*not\*\* top-level domain objects.



| Artifact         | Domain        |

| ---------------- | ------------- |

| Decision         | Authorization |

| Policy Snapshot  | Authorization |

| Execution Permit | Authorization |

| Signals          | Evidence      |

| Attestation      | Evidence      |

| Receipt          | Evidence      |

| Signature        | Evidence      |

| Hash             | Evidence      |

| Ledger Record    | Evidence      |

| Trust Report     | Verification  |

| Replay           | Verification  |

| Integrity Check  | Verification  |

\# Domain Invariants



Every ExecutionTransaction must satisfy the following invariants.



\### Authority



Execution originates from a recognized authority.



\---



\### Intent



Execution matches immutable intent.



\---



\### Authorization



Execution is explicitly authorized.



\---



\### Execution



Execution is permanently recorded.



\---



\### Evidence



Evidence is independently verifiable.



\---



\### Verification



Execution matches authorized intent.



\---



\# Aggregate Lifecycle



```text

Authority

&#x20;     ↓

Intent

&#x20;     ↓

Authorization

&#x20;     ↓

Execution

&#x20;     ↓

Evidence

&#x20;     ↓

Verification

&#x20;     ↓

Execution Trust

```



This lifecycle defines every ExecutionTransaction.



\---



\# Evolution Rules



The following objects are permanent architectural concepts.



\* ExecutionTransaction

\* Authority

\* Intent

\* Authorization

\* Execution

\* Evidence

\* Verification

\* CryptoProfile



Implementation artifacts may evolve without changing the domain model.



New domain objects require an architecture decision and an update to this document.



\---



\# Success Criterion



The domain model succeeds when every execution can be represented by a single ExecutionTransaction whose Authority, Intent, Authorization, Execution, Evidence, and Verification are sufficient for an independent verifier to determine whether execution matched authorized intent.
