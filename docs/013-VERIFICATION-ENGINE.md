\# 013 — Verification Engine



\## Status



\*\*Version:\*\* 0.1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Draft



\*\*Audience:\*\* Architecture, Runtime, Verification, SDK



\---



\# Purpose



The Verification Engine independently evaluates whether an `ExecutionTransaction` satisfies the Parmana Execution Trust Model.



The Verification Engine never executes business logic.



It never authorizes execution.



It never modifies transactions.



Its sole responsibility is to determine whether execution faithfully reflects the authorized intent and whether sufficient evidence exists to establish trust.



\---



\# Design Principles



The Verification Engine is:



\* Deterministic

\* Independent

\* Immutable

\* Reproducible

\* Technology Agnostic

\* Side-Effect Free



Verification must always produce the same result for the same immutable transaction.



\---



\# Responsibilities



The Verification Engine SHALL:



\* Verify Authority

\* Verify Intent

\* Verify Authorization

\* Verify Execution

\* Verify Evidence

\* Verify Cryptographic Integrity

\* Produce immutable verification reports



The Verification Engine SHALL NOT:



\* Execute workflows

\* Evaluate business policy

\* Persist transactions

\* Modify evidence

\* Generate new execution artifacts

\# Verification Pipeline



Verification SHALL occur in the following order.



\## Stage 1



Authority Verification



Questions answered:



\* Does the authority exist?

\* Is the authority correctly represented?

\* Is the authority internally consistent?



\---



\## Stage 2



Intent Verification



Questions answered:



\* Is intent present?

\* Is intent complete?

\* Is intent immutable?



\---



\## Stage 3



Authorization Verification



Questions answered:



\* Does authorization exist?

\* Is the authorization decision internally consistent?

\* Is authorization bound to the transaction?



\---



\## Stage 4



Execution Verification



Questions answered:



\* Did execution complete?

\* Is execution internally consistent?

\* Does execution satisfy the recorded authorization?



\---



\## Stage 5



Evidence Verification



Questions answered:



\* Is evidence present?

\* Is evidence complete?

\* Are required artifacts available?

\* Is evidence immutable?



\---



\## Stage 6



Integrity Verification



Questions answered:



\* Are hashes valid?

\* Are signatures valid?

\* Has the transaction been modified?

\* Can integrity be independently established?



\---



\# Verification Report



Verification produces a single immutable report.



A report contains:



\* Overall Status

\* Verification Timestamp

\* Individual Verification Results

\* Optional Messages

\* Metadata



Reports never modify the original transaction.



\---



\# Verification Result



Each verifier produces:



\* Component Name

\* Status

\* Message (optional)



Example:



```text

Authority        PASS

Intent           PASS

Authorization    PASS

Execution        PASS

Evidence         PASS

Integrity        PASS

```



\---



\# Failure Model



Verification failures are explicit.



Typical outcomes include:



\* PASS

\* FAIL

\* INCOMPLETE

\* UNKNOWN



Verification never throws business exceptions as part of normal evaluation.



Failures are represented as verification results.



\---



\# Determinism



Verification MUST be deterministic.



Given the same immutable `ExecutionTransaction`, every compliant implementation SHALL produce the same verification report.



\---



\# Runtime Relationship



The Runtime creates facts.



The Verification Engine evaluates facts.



The Runtime and Verification Engine remain independent components.

```



\---



\# Extensibility



Additional verifiers MAY be introduced in future versions.



Examples include:



\* ComplianceVerifier

\* PolicyVerifier

\* AttestationVerifier

\* ReplayVerifier

\* AuditVerifier



New verifiers SHALL NOT alter the behavior of existing verifiers.

\# Implementation Notes



The Verification Engine operates exclusively on immutable domain objects defined in the Core package.



Verification implementations must remain independent of runtime orchestration, storage systems, transport protocols, and user interfaces.



This separation ensures that verification remains portable, deterministic, and independently auditable across all Parmana deployments.
