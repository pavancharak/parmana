\# Execution Lifecycle Model v1 (Locked)



\## Status



\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Locked



\---



\# Purpose



The Execution Lifecycle defines the state progression of an Execution from creation to completion.



Execution duration is independent of the Execution Trust Model.



Whether an Execution completes immediately or over an extended period, the lifecycle and trust guarantees remain identical.



\---



\# Scope



This specification defines:



\* Execution lifecycle

\* Execution state transitions

\* Terminal states

\* Long-running execution

\* Relationship to transport

\* Relationship to the Execution Trust Record



This specification does \*\*not\*\* define:



\* Execution creation

\* Decision generation

\* Override processing

\* Verification



\---



\# Execution Lifecycle



Every Execution progresses through the following lifecycle:



```text id="mqi8eu"

Execution Created



&#x20;       │



&#x20;       ▼



PROCESSING



&#x20;       │



&#x20;┌──────┴──────┐



&#x20;▼             ▼



COMPLETED    FAILED

```



\---



\# Lifecycle States



\## PROCESSING



The Execution has been accepted and is currently executing.



The duration of this state is implementation-dependent.



\---



\## COMPLETED



The Execution completed successfully.



The Execution reaches a terminal state.



\---



\## FAILED



The Execution did not complete successfully.



The Execution reaches a terminal state.



Failure does not invalidate the Business Transaction.



\---



\# Lifecycle Rules



\## Rule 1



Every Execution begins in the `PROCESSING` state.



\---



\## Rule 2



Every Execution eventually reaches exactly one terminal state:



\* `COMPLETED`

\* `FAILED`



\---



\## Rule 3



Once a terminal state is reached, the Execution state never changes.



\---



\## Rule 4



Execution duration has no architectural significance.



The lifecycle is identical whether execution lasts:



\* milliseconds

\* seconds

\* minutes

\* hours



\---



\## Rule 5



Execution state changes do not modify:



\* Business Transaction

\* Metadata

\* Policy

\* Signals

\* Decision

\* Override History



Only the Execution state progresses.



\---



\## Rule 6



Execution retries create new Execution resources.



They never restart or modify an existing Execution.



\---



\# Long-Running Execution



Long-running execution is not a separate architectural concept.



It is simply an Execution that remains in the `PROCESSING` state for an extended period.



Example:



```text id="9yxjlwm"

Execution



↓



PROCESSING



↓



45 Minutes



↓



COMPLETED

```



No special lifecycle is introduced.



\---



\# Transport Independence



The Execution Lifecycle is independent of transport.



Implementations may use:



\* Blocking HTTP

\* HTTP 202 Accepted with polling

\* Webhooks

\* Message queues

\* Event streaming



All transport mechanisms must preserve the same lifecycle semantics.



\---



\# Relationship to Business Transaction



The Business Transaction remains immutable throughout the Execution lifecycle.



Only the associated Execution resource changes state.



\---



\# Relationship to Execution Trust Record



The Execution Trust Record records:



\* Execution creation

\* Lifecycle state

\* Terminal outcome

\* Evidence



The Trust Record is finalized when the Execution reaches a terminal state.



\---



\# Relationship to Replay



Replay reproduces the recorded lifecycle.



Replay does not alter lifecycle states.



\---



\# Relationship to Verification



Verification validates:



\* Lifecycle integrity

\* State transitions

\* Terminal state

\* Execution ordering



Verification does not determine whether the duration of execution was acceptable.



\---



\# Failure Handling



If an Execution reaches the `FAILED` state:



The Business Transaction remains valid.



A new Execution may be created.



Example:



```text id="vynxmy"

Business Transaction



↓



Execution #1



FAILED



↓



Execution #2



COMPLETED

```



Execution history remains append-only.



\---



\# Canonical Principles



\## Principle 1



Every Execution has a defined lifecycle.



\---



\## Principle 2



Execution duration is independent of the trust model.



\---



\## Principle 3



Every Execution reaches exactly one terminal state.



\---



\## Principle 4



Execution lifecycle is independent of transport.



\---



\## Principle 5



Execution retries create new Executions.



\---



\## Principle 6



Business Transactions remain immutable throughout execution.



\---



\## Principle 7



The Execution Trust Record is finalized when the Execution reaches a terminal state.



\---



\# Canonical Model



```text id="fdvlhl"

Business Transaction



&#x20;       │



&#x20;       ▼



Execution



&#x20;       │



&#x20;       ▼



PROCESSING



&#x20;       │



&#x20;┌──────┴──────┐



&#x20;▼             ▼



COMPLETED    FAILED



&#x20;       │



&#x20;       ▼



Execution Trust Record Finalized

```



\---



\# Summary



The Execution Lifecycle Model defines the deterministic progression of an Execution from creation to a terminal state.



It separates execution state management from transport mechanisms, ensuring that short-running and long-running executions share the same architectural model.



By treating lifecycle progression as immutable state transitions, Parmana guarantees deterministic replay, independent verification, and consistent trust recording regardless of execution duration or deployment architecture.
