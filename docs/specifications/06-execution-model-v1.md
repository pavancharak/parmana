\# Execution Model v1 (Locked)



\## Status



\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Locked



\---



\# Purpose



An \*\*Execution\*\* represents a single attempt to realize the business intent of a Business Transaction.



Execution occurs only after an effective decision has authorized the Business Transaction.



A Business Transaction may have one or more Executions.



Each Execution is an immutable resource and becomes part of the Execution Trust Record.



\---



\# Scope



This specification defines:



\* Execution ownership

\* Execution creation

\* Execution identity

\* Execution immutability

\* Relationship to Business Transaction

\* Relationship to Decision

\* Relationship to Override

\* Relationship to Evidence



This specification does \*\*not\*\* define:



\* Execution lifecycle

\* Execution states

\* Transport mechanisms

\* Verification



\---



\# Definition



A Business Transaction represents business intent.



An Execution represents an attempt to realize that intent.



Business intent is immutable.



Execution may be attempted multiple times.



\---



\# Execution Flow



```text id="u3qfye"

Business Transaction



&#x20;       │



&#x20;       ▼



Decision



&#x20;       │



(Optional Override)



&#x20;       │



&#x20;       ▼



Execution

```



Execution begins only after an effective decision exists.



\---



\# Ownership



Every Execution belongs to exactly one Business Transaction.



A Business Transaction may own:



\* Zero Executions

\* One Execution

\* Multiple Executions



\---



\# Execution Identity



Every Execution has a unique identifier.



Example:



```text id="b3u9pm"

executionId



EXEC-0001



EXEC-0002



EXEC-0003

```



Execution identifiers are unique within the Business Transaction.



\---



\# Canonical Resource Model



```text id="z6wh5l"

Business Transaction



├── Execution #1



├── Execution #2



└── Execution #3

```



\---



\# Execution Rules



\## Rule 1



An Execution can only be created for an existing Business Transaction.



\---



\## Rule 2



Execution requires an effective decision.



The effective decision is:



\* Original Decision, or

\* Active Override



\---



\## Rule 3



Each Execution represents exactly one execution attempt.



\---



\## Rule 4



Executions are immutable.



Once recorded, an Execution cannot be modified or deleted.



\---



\## Rule 5



Creating a new Execution never creates a new Business Transaction.



Execution retries remain part of the same Business Transaction.



\---



\## Rule 6



Execution history is append-only.



Every Execution is permanently preserved.



\---



\# Relationship to Decision



Execution is authorized by the effective decision.



Example:



```text id="sm3mij"

Decision



APPROVED



↓



Execution

```



or



```text id="jjlwmu"

Decision



REJECTED



↓



Override



APPROVED



↓



Execution

```



Execution never changes the Decision.



\---



\# Relationship to Override



Overrides determine whether Execution is permitted after a rejected Decision.



Execution records the effective authorization but never modifies Override history.



\---



\# Relationship to Evidence



Every Execution owns its own Evidence.



```text id="gw0lu7"

Execution



├── Outcome



├── Evidence



└── Timestamp

```



Evidence is part of the Execution and is never shared across Executions.



\---



\# Relationship to the Execution Trust Record



Every Execution becomes part of the immutable Execution Trust Record.



```text id="90vv3i"

Execution Trust Record



├── Executions



│      ├── Execution #1



│      ├── Execution #2



│      └── Execution #3

```



\---



\# Replay



Replay reproduces every recorded Execution.



Execution history is replayed in chronological order.



Replay never removes or creates Executions.



\---



\# Verification



Verification validates:



\* Execution identity

\* Execution integrity

\* Execution ordering

\* Execution evidence

\* Linkage to the Business Transaction



Verification does not determine whether the execution outcome was desirable from a business perspective.



\---



\# Failure



Execution failure does not invalidate the Business Transaction.



Instead:



A new Execution may be created.



Example:



```text id="rnlx7g"

Business Transaction



↓



Execution #1



FAILED



↓



Execution #2



FAILED



↓



Execution #3



COMPLETED

```



The Business Transaction remains unchanged.



\---

\## Principle 4



Executions are immutable.



\---

\# Summary



The Execution Model defines how a Business Transaction is realized after authorization.



Executions are immutable, append-only resources that represent individual execution attempts. Multiple Executions may exist for a single Business Transaction without altering the original business intent.



Each Execution maintains its own Evidence and becomes a permanent component of the Execution Trust Record, enabling deterministic replay, independent verification, and complete execution auditability.
