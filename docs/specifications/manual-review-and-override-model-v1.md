\# Parmana Manual Review and Override Model v1 (Locked)



\## Status



\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Locked



\---



\# Purpose



Parmana provides \*\*Execution Trust Infrastructure\*\*.



Policy evaluation produces an initial decision.



Business organizations may require human review before a final execution decision is reached.



This specification defines the canonical Manual Review and Override model.



\---



\# Design Principle



A \*\*Policy Decision\*\* is always the first decision.



A \*\*Human Review\*\* is an optional business process that occurs after a policy decision.



An \*\*Override\*\* is not a workflow.



An \*\*Override\*\* is one possible outcome of a Manual Review.



\---

\# Manual Review



Manual Review is initiated by the business workflow.



Parmana does not determine whether a transaction should be manually reviewed.



The calling application or business process decides whether manual review is required.



A common organizational policy may state:



> Every rejected transaction is routed for manual review.



Parmana records the outcome but does not enforce this workflow.



\---



\# Manual Review Outcomes



A Manual Review has exactly two outcomes.



\## Outcome 1



\*\*Confirm Rejection\*\*



The reviewer agrees with the policy decision.



No override is created.



The transaction remains rejected.



\---



\## Outcome 2



\*\*Override Approval\*\*



The reviewer disagrees with the policy decision.



A Human Override Decision is created.



The transaction proceeds through the normal execution trust pipeline.



\---



\# Override Definition



An Override exists only when the final human decision differs from the original policy decision.



Example:



```text

Policy Decision



REJECT



↓



Human Decision



APPROVE

```



This creates an Override.



Example:



```text

Policy Decision



REJECT



↓



Human Decision



REJECT

```



This does not create an Override.



It records a confirmed rejection.



\---



\# Trust Record



Every Business Transaction maintains a complete append-only history.



```text

Business Transaction



├── Policy Decision

│

├── Manual Review

│

├── Review Outcome

│

├── Override (if applicable)

│

├── Execution

│

├── Evidence

│

├── Verification

│

└── Receipt

```



Nothing is removed.



Nothing is replaced.



History is append-only.



\---



\# Responsibilities



\## Business Application



Responsible for:



\* Routing rejected transactions to manual review.

\* Assigning reviewers.

\* Initiating review.

\* Calling Parmana with the review outcome.



\---



\## Parmana



Responsible for:



\* Recording the policy decision.

\* Recording the manual review outcome.

\* Verifying reviewer authority.

\* Recording an override when applicable.

\* Maintaining the append-only trust record.

\* Generating execution evidence.

\* Generating verification artifacts.



\---



\# Canonical Principles



\## Principle 1



Every transaction begins with a Policy Decision.



\---



\## Principle 2



Manual Review is a business workflow.



It is external to Parmana.



\---



\## Principle 3



An Override is not a workflow.



It is one possible outcome of a Manual Review.



\---



\## Principle 4



Confirming a rejection does not create an Override.



\---



\## Principle 5



Only a human decision that changes the policy decision creates an Override.



\---



\## Principle 6



The original Policy Decision is never modified or removed.



\---



\## Principle 7



Every decision, review, and override is permanently recorded within the Business Transaction's Execution Trust Record.



\---

This model establishes the relationship between policy decisions, manual review, and overrides while preserving Parmana's core principle of an append-only, verifiable execution trust record.
