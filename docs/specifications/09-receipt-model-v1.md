\# Receipt Model v1 (Locked)



\## Status



\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Locked



\---



\# Purpose



A \*\*Receipt\*\* is a compact, cryptographically verifiable representation of an Execution Trust Record.



The Receipt provides portable proof that Parmana processed a Business Transaction and produced an Execution Trust Record.



Receipts are intended for:



\* Sharing

\* Auditing

\* Long-term storage

\* Independent verification



The Receipt is \*\*not\*\* the Execution Trust Record.



\---



\# Scope



This specification defines:



\* Receipt purpose

\* Receipt generation

\* Receipt contents

\* Receipt guarantees

\* Relationship to the Execution Trust Record

\* Relationship to Verification



This specification does \*\*not\*\* define:



\* Verification

\* Policy Evaluation

\* Execution

\* Trust Chain



\---



\# Receipt Generation



A Receipt is generated after an Execution reaches a terminal state.



Terminal states:



\* `COMPLETED`

\* `FAILED`



Exactly one Receipt is generated for each Execution.



\---



\# Receipt Flow



```text id="t6pyfv"

Business Transaction



&#x20;       │



&#x20;       ▼



Execution



&#x20;       │



&#x20;       ▼



Execution Trust Record



&#x20;       │



&#x20;       ▼



Receipt

```



The Receipt is always derived from the Execution Trust Record.

\# Receipt Object



Canonical structure:



```json id="6ps2db"

{

&#x20; "receipt": {

&#x20;   "receiptId": "RCT-000001",

&#x20;   "businessTransactionId": "PAY-1001",

&#x20;   "executionId": "EXEC-0001",

&#x20;   "executionTrustRecordId": "ETR-000001",

&#x20;   "policy": {

&#x20;     "name": "payment-approval",

&#x20;     "version": "2.1.0",

&#x20;     "schemaVersion": "1.0"

&#x20;   },

&#x20;   "decision": "APPROVED",

&#x20;   "executionOutcome": "COMPLETED",

&#x20;   "issuedAt": "2026-06-26T12:00:00Z",

&#x20;   "executionTrustRecordHash": "...",

&#x20;   "signature": "...",

&#x20;   "receiptVersion": "1.0"

&#x20; }

}

```



\---



\# Required Fields



Every Receipt SHALL contain:



\* receiptId

\* businessTransactionId

\* executionId

\* executionTrustRecordId

\* policy

\* decision

\* executionOutcome

\* issuedAt

\* executionTrustRecordHash

\* signature

\* receiptVersion



\---



\# Receipt Guarantees



A valid Receipt guarantees that:



\* Parmana processed the identified Business Transaction.

\* Parmana created the referenced Execution Trust Record.

\* The Receipt corresponds to that exact Execution Trust Record.

\* The Receipt has not been modified since issuance.

\* The Receipt can be independently verified using Parmana's public verification key.



\---



\# Receipt Does Not Guarantee



A Receipt does \*\*not\*\* guarantee:



\* That the business decision was correct.

\* That the business policy was appropriate.

\* That execution succeeded (a Receipt may represent a failed Execution).

\* That external systems behaved correctly.



The Receipt guarantees only the integrity and authenticity of Parmana's recorded trust artifacts.



\---



\# Cryptographic Integrity



Every Receipt is cryptographically protected.



Generation flow:



```text id="rtm87t"

Execution Trust Record



&#x20;       │



&#x20;       ▼



Canonical Serialization



&#x20;       │



&#x20;       ▼



Hash



&#x20;       │



&#x20;       ▼



Digital Signature



&#x20;       │



&#x20;       ▼



Receipt

```



The signature enables independent verification without requiring access to Parmana.



\---



\# Independent Verification



Any verifier possessing Parmana's public verification key can:



\* Validate the Receipt signature.

\* Validate the Receipt integrity.

\* Confirm that the Receipt corresponds to the referenced Execution Trust Record.



Independent verification does not require re-executing the Business Transaction.



\---



\# Relationship to the Execution Trust Record



The Execution Trust Record is the authoritative source.



The Receipt is a compact representation derived from it.



```text id="3jptb2"

Execution Trust Record



&#x20;       │



&#x20;       ▼



Receipt

```



The Receipt never replaces the Execution Trust Record.



\---



\# Relationship to Verification



Verification validates:



\* Receipt integrity.

\* Receipt signature.

\* Receipt linkage to the Execution Trust Record.



Verification does not regenerate Receipts.



\---



\# Receipt Immutability



Receipts are immutable.



Once issued:



\* Contents cannot be modified.

\* Signature cannot be regenerated.

\* Receipt cannot be replaced.



If a new Execution occurs, a new Receipt is generated for that Execution.



\---



\# Canonical Principles



\## Principle 1



The Receipt is a portable trust artifact.



\---



\## Principle 2



Every Receipt is derived from exactly one Execution Trust Record.



\---



\## Principle 3



Every Execution has exactly one Receipt.



\---



\## Principle 4



Receipts are cryptographically signed.



\---



\## Principle 5



Receipts are independently verifiable.



\---



\## Principle 6



Receipts are immutable.



\---



\## Principle 7



Receipts never replace the Execution Trust Record.

\# Summary



The Receipt Model defines the portable, cryptographically verifiable artifact issued by Parmana after an Execution reaches a terminal state.



A Receipt provides compact proof that Parmana processed a specific Business Transaction, produced an Execution Trust Record, and protected that record with cryptographic integrity.



By separating the Receipt from the Execution Trust Record, Parmana enables secure sharing, long-term retention, and independent verification without exposing the complete internal trust record.
