\# Verification Model v1 (Locked)



\## Status



\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Locked



\---



\# Purpose



Verification establishes the integrity, authenticity, and internal consistency of the Execution Trust Record associated with a Business Transaction.



Verification confirms that the recorded trust artifacts have not been altered and remain internally consistent.



Verification does \*\*not\*\* re-evaluate business policy or determine whether the underlying business decision was correct.



\---



\# Scope



This specification defines:



\* Verification purpose

\* Verification scope

\* Verification checks

\* Verification outcomes

\* Relationship to the Execution Trust Record

\* Relationship to Receipt



This specification does \*\*not\*\* define:



\* Policy Evaluation

\* Override processing

\* Execution

\* Receipt generation

Verification Result

```



Verification operates on an existing Execution Trust Record.



\---



\# Verification Scope



Verification validates the integrity of the following trust artifacts:



\* Business Transaction

\* Metadata

\* Policy

\* Decision

\* Override History

\* Executions

\* Evidence

\* Receipt



Every check is deterministic.



\---



\# Verification Checks



\## Business Transaction Integrity



Confirms:



\* Business Transaction exists.

\* Identifier is valid.

\* Immutable fields remain unchanged.



\---



\## Metadata Integrity



Confirms:



\* Recorded Metadata has not changed.

\* Required Metadata fields remain intact.



\---



\## Policy Integrity



Confirms:



\* Policy Name matches.

\* Policy Version matches.

\* Schema Version matches.



Verification never substitutes newer policy versions.



\---



\## Decision Integrity



Confirms:



\* Recorded Decision exists.

\* Decision is linked to the recorded Policy.

\* Decision has not been modified.



\---



\## Override Integrity



Confirms:



\* Override History is append-only.

\* Active Override is valid.

\* Recorded Override identity and timestamps remain intact.



\---



\## Execution Integrity



Confirms:



\* Execution ordering.

\* Execution identifiers.

\* Execution outcomes.

\* Lifecycle consistency.



\---



\## Evidence Integrity



Confirms:



\* Evidence belongs to the recorded Execution.

\* Evidence has not been modified.



\---



\## Receipt Integrity



Confirms:



\* Receipt corresponds to the Execution Trust Record.

\* Receipt signature is valid.

\* Receipt has not been altered.



\---



\# Verification Result



Verification produces:



```json id="ub93gf"

{

&#x20; "verified": true,

&#x20; "checks": {

&#x20;   "businessTransaction": true,

&#x20;   "metadata": true,

&#x20;   "policy": true,

&#x20;   "decision": true,

&#x20;   "override": true,

&#x20;   "execution": true,

&#x20;   "evidence": true,

&#x20;   "receipt": true

&#x20; }

}

```



If one or more checks fail:



```json id="yhjwd9"

{

&#x20; "verified": false,

&#x20; "checks": {

&#x20;   "businessTransaction": true,

&#x20;   "metadata": true,

&#x20;   "policy": false,

&#x20;   "decision": true,

&#x20;   "override": true,

&#x20;   "execution": false,

&#x20;   "evidence": true,

&#x20;   "receipt": true

&#x20; }

}

```



Verification reports the outcome of \*\*every\*\* check.



It does not stop after the first failure.



\---



\# Verification Rules



\## Rule 1



Verification never modifies the Execution Trust Record.



\---



\## Rule 2



Verification validates recorded artifacts only.



It never regenerates Decisions or Overrides.



\---



\## Rule 3



Verification never performs Policy Resolution.



Recorded policy information is always used.



\---



\## Rule 4



Verification validates every trust artifact independently.



\---



\## Rule 5



Verification may be executed multiple times.



Every verification event is recorded in the Verification History.



\---



\# Relationship to Replay



Replay reproduces the recorded artifacts.



Verification validates the recorded artifacts.



Replay and Verification are complementary operations.



\---



\# Relationship to Receipt



Verification validates Receipt integrity.



Receipt validation includes:



\* Signature verification.

\* Trust Record linkage.

\* Receipt integrity.



\---



\# Relationship to Execution Trust Record



Every Verification event becomes part of the Verification History.



```text id="zqvdkv"

Execution Trust Record



├── Verification #1



├── Verification #2



└── Verification #3

```



Verification history is append-only.



\---



\# Failure



Verification fails if any required integrity check fails.



Examples include:



\* Modified Metadata.

\* Policy mismatch.

\* Invalid Receipt signature.

\* Missing Execution.

\* Corrupted Evidence.



A failed verification does not modify the Execution Trust Record.



\---



\# Canonical Principles



\## Principle 1



Verification establishes trust in recorded artifacts.



\---



\## Principle 2



Verification validates integrity, not business correctness.



\---



\## Principle 3



Verification is deterministic.



\---



\## Principle 4



Verification never modifies trust artifacts.



\---



\## Principle 5



Verification validates every trust artifact independently.



\---



\## Principle 6



Verification history is append-only.



\---



\## Principle 7



Verification always uses the recorded policy.

\# Summary



The Verification Model defines how Parmana establishes trust in a Business Transaction by validating the integrity, authenticity, and consistency of its Execution Trust Record.



Verification operates exclusively on recorded artifacts, never modifies historical data, and produces a deterministic verification result that can be repeated independently over time.



By recording every verification event in an append-only Verification History, Parmana provides continuous, auditable evidence that the Execution Trust Record remains authentic and internally consistent throughout its lifetime.
