\# Execution Trust Record Model v1 (Locked)



\## Status



\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Locked



\---



\# Purpose



The \*\*Execution Trust Record (ETR)\*\* is the canonical, immutable, append-only trust record for a Business Transaction.



It permanently records every trust artifact generated throughout the lifecycle of a Business Transaction.



The Execution Trust Record is the authoritative source for:



\* Replay

\* Verification

\* Audit

\* Compliance

\* Independent trust validation



Every Business Transaction owns exactly one Execution Trust Record.



\---



\# Scope



This specification defines:



\* Execution Trust Record purpose

\* Ownership

\* Structure

\* Immutability

\* Append-only behavior

\* Relationship to the Trust Chain

\* Relationship to Verification

\* Relationship to Receipt



This specification does \*\*not\*\* define:



\* Policy evaluation

\* Override processing

\* Execution lifecycle

\* Authentication



\---



\# Definition



The Execution Trust Record is the complete trust history of a Business Transaction.



It records:



\* What was requested

\* Which policy was applied

\* What decision was produced

\* Whether an Override occurred

\* Every Execution

\* Every Verification

\* Every Receipt



The Execution Trust Record never changes historical facts.



\---



\# Ownership



Every Business Transaction owns exactly one Execution Trust Record.

The Execution Trust Record cannot exist independently of a Business Transaction.

\# Components



\## Metadata



Immutable transaction identity and contextual information.



\---



\## Policy



The resolved policy used during evaluation.



Includes:



\* Name

\* Version

\* Schema Version



\---



\## Signals



The immutable business input supplied by the calling application.



Signals are evaluated by the recorded Policy.



\---



\## Decision



The immutable policy evaluation result.



Exactly one Decision exists for every successfully evaluated Business Transaction.



\---



\## Override History



Append-only collection of Override Decisions.



The original Decision is never modified.



\---



\## Executions



Append-only collection of Execution resources.



Each Execution contains:



\* Lifecycle

\* Outcome

\* Evidence

\* Receipt



\---



\## Verification History



Append-only collection of Verification events.



Each Verification validates the integrity of the Execution Trust Record without modifying it.



\---



\## Trust Metadata



System-generated trust information.



Examples include:



\* Record Version

\* Created Timestamp

\* Last Verification Timestamp

\* Cryptographic Metadata



The Trust Metadata never alters the recorded business facts.



\---



\# Immutability



The Execution Trust Record is immutable.



Recorded artifacts are never:



\* Modified

\* Deleted

\* Reordered



Historical truth is permanently preserved.



\---



\# Append-Only Model



The following collections are append-only:



\* Override History

\* Executions

\* Verification History



New trust artifacts are appended.



Existing artifacts remain unchanged.



\---



\# Relationship to Trust Chain



The Trust Chain is a representation of the Execution Trust Record.



It is not a separate data structure.

Trust Chain Representation

```



The Trust Chain never introduces new information.



\---



\# Relationship to Replay



Replay always operates against the Execution Trust Record.



Replay uses the recorded:



\* Metadata

\* Policy

\* Signals

\* Decision

\* Override History

\* Executions



Replay never modifies the Execution Trust Record.



\---



\# Relationship to Verification



Verification validates the integrity and consistency of the Execution Trust Record.



Every Verification event is recorded in the Verification History.



Verification never modifies historical trust artifacts.



\---



\# Relationship to Receipt



Receipts are derived from Executions within the Execution Trust Record.



Each Execution has exactly one Receipt.



The Receipt is a portable representation of recorded trust information.



\---



\# Canonical Principles



\## Principle 1



The Execution Trust Record is the canonical trust object in Parmana.



\---



\## Principle 2



Every Business Transaction owns exactly one Execution Trust Record.



\---



\## Principle 3



The Execution Trust Record is immutable.



\---



\## Principle 4



Historical trust artifacts are append-only.



\---



\## Principle 5



Replay, Verification, Audit, and Compliance operate on the Execution Trust Record.



\---



\## Principle 6



The Trust Chain is a representation of the Execution Trust Record.



\---



\## Principle 7



Receipts and Verification events are derived from the Execution Trust Record.

\# Summary



The Execution Trust Record is the authoritative trust artifact within Parmana.



It provides a complete, immutable, append-only record of every trust artifact associated with a Business Transaction, from the original Metadata and Policy through Decision, Override History, Executions, Verification History, and Receipts.



By making the Execution Trust Record the single source of truth, Parmana enables deterministic replay, independent verification, comprehensive auditability, regulatory compliance, and long-term execution trust without altering historical business facts.
