\# Decision Model v1 (Locked)



\## Status



\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Locked



\---



\# Purpose



A \*\*Decision\*\* is the deterministic outcome produced by evaluating a Business Transaction against a resolved Policy.



The Decision represents Parmana's policy evaluation result.



It determines whether the Business Transaction is:



\* Approved

\* Rejected



The Decision is immutable and becomes part of the Execution Trust Record.



\---



\# Scope



This specification defines:



\* Decision generation

\* Decision outcomes

\* Decision immutability

\* Decision ownership

\* Relationship to Override

\* Relationship to Execution



This specification does \*\*not\*\* define:



\* Policy Resolution

\* Override processing

\* Execution

\* Verification

\# Decision Flow



```text

Business Transaction



&#x20;       │



&#x20;       ▼



Policy Resolution



&#x20;       │



&#x20;       ▼



Policy Evaluation



&#x20;       │



&#x20;       ▼



Decision

```



A Decision is produced only after successful Policy Resolution.



\---



\# Decision Outcomes



Parmana produces exactly one of the following outcomes:



```text

APPROVED



REJECTED

```



No other Decision outcomes are defined in Version 1.



\---



\# Decision Object



Canonical structure:



```json

{

&#x20; "decision": {

&#x20;   "outcome": "APPROVED",

&#x20;   "evaluatedAt": "2026-06-26T10:30:00Z"

&#x20; }

}

```

\# Decision Fields



| Field       | Required | Description                             |

| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |

| outcome     | Yes      | APPROVED or REJECTED                    |

| evaluatedAt | Yes      | UTC timestamp when evaluation completed |



Additional implementation-specific fields may be included provided they do not alter the Decision semantics.



\---



\# Decision Rules



\## Rule 1



Exactly one Decision is produced for every successfully evaluated Business Transaction.



\---



\## Rule 2



A Decision is produced only after successful Policy Resolution.



\---



\## Rule 3



A Decision is deterministic.



Given:



\* identical Business Transaction

\* identical Metadata

\* identical Policy

\* identical Signals



the Decision must always be identical.



\---



\## Rule 4



Once created, a Decision is immutable.



It is never modified or deleted.



\---



\## Rule 5



A Decision cannot be re-evaluated.



Any subsequent business action (such as an Override) creates a new trust artifact without changing the original Decision.



\---



\# Relationship to Override



If the Decision is:



```text

REJECTED

```



the calling application may initiate an Override.



The original Decision remains permanently recorded.



The Override never replaces the Decision.



Example:



```text

Decision



REJECTED



↓



Override



APPROVED

```



Both artifacts become part of the Execution Trust Record.



\---



\# Relationship to Execution



Execution is based on the effective decision.



If:



```text

Decision = APPROVED

```



Execution may proceed.



If:



```text

Decision = REJECTED

```



Execution stops unless a valid Override changes the effective decision.



\---



\# Relationship to Replay



Replay never reinterprets a Decision.



Replay re-evaluates the Business Transaction using the recorded:



\* Policy

\* Policy Version

\* Schema Version

\* Signals



The replay result is compared with the recorded Decision to verify deterministic behavior.



\---



\# Relationship to Verification



Verification validates:



\* Decision integrity

\* Decision consistency

\* Decision linkage to the recorded Policy

\* Decision linkage to the Business Transaction



Verification does not determine whether the Decision was "correct" from a business perspective.



\---



\# Relationship to the Execution Trust Record



Every Decision is permanently recorded.



```text

Execution Trust Record



├── Metadata



├── Policy



├── Signals



├── Decision



└── ...

```



The Decision is never replaced by an Override.



\---



\# Failure



If Policy Resolution fails:



No Decision is produced.



If Policy Evaluation fails due to an internal system error:



No Decision is recorded.



The Business Transaction transitions to a failure state according to the Business Transaction State Model.



\---



\# Canonical Principles



\## Principle 1



A Decision is the deterministic outcome of Policy Evaluation.



\---



\## Principle 2



Every successfully evaluated Business Transaction has exactly one Decision.



\---



\## Principle 3



A Decision is immutable.



\---



\## Principle 4



A Decision is never replaced by an Override.



\---



\## Principle 5



Replay validates the recorded Decision against deterministic policy evaluation.



\---



\## Principle 6



Verification validates Decision integrity, not business correctness.

\# Summary



The Decision Model defines the deterministic outcome of evaluating a Business Transaction against a resolved Policy.



A Decision is immutable, uniquely associated with a single Business Transaction, and permanently recorded within the Execution Trust Record.



It serves as the authoritative policy outcome upon which Overrides, Executions, Receipts, and Verification are built, while preserving a complete and auditable history of the original policy evaluation.
