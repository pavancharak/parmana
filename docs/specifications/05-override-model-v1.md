\# Override Model v1 (Locked)



\## Status



\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Locked



\---



\# Purpose



An \*\*Override\*\* is an explicit, human-authorized decision that supersedes a previously rejected policy Decision.



Overrides exist to handle exceptional business situations that cannot be resolved through automated policy evaluation.



An Override never replaces the original Decision. Instead, it creates a new immutable trust artifact that becomes part of the Execution Trust Record.



\---



\# Scope



This specification defines:



\* Override creation

\* Override lifecycle

\* Override constraints

\* Override ownership

\* Relationship to Decision

\* Relationship to Execution



This specification does \*\*not\*\* define:



\* Policy Resolution

\* Policy Evaluation

\* Execution

\* Verification

\* Authentication and Authorization

```



Manual Review is performed by the calling organization.



Parmana records only the resulting Override.



\---



\# Override Purpose



Overrides exist only for exceptional business situations.



Typical examples include:



\* Manager approval

\* Regulatory exception

\* Emergency operation

\* Risk acceptance

\* Business exception



Parmana does not determine whether an Override should occur.

\# Override Object



Canonical structure:



```json

{

&#x20; "override": {

&#x20;   "outcome": "APPROVED",

&#x20;   "reason": "Manager approved exception",

&#x20;   "overriddenBy": "manager-001",

&#x20;   "overriddenAt": "2026-06-26T11:30:00Z"

| ------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |

| outcome      | Yes      | Override outcome                               |

| reason       | Yes      | Business justification                         |

| overriddenBy | Yes      | Authenticated identity initiating the override |

| overriddenAt | Yes      | UTC timestamp                                  |

\# Override Rules



\## Rule 1



Overrides may only be created after a Decision has been recorded.



\---



\## Rule 2



Overrides are intended for rejected Decisions.



Approved Decisions do not require Overrides.



\---



\## Rule 3



Overrides never modify the original Decision.



The original Decision remains permanently recorded.



\---



\## Rule 4



Overrides are immutable.



Once recorded, an Override cannot be modified or deleted.



\---



\## Rule 5



Override history is append-only.



Every Override attempt is permanently recorded.



\---



\## Rule 6



Only one Override may be active for a Business Transaction.



Historical Overrides remain recorded but become inactive once superseded according to organizational policy.



\---



\## Rule 7



Overrides cannot be created after Execution has reached a terminal state.



If Execution has:



\* COMPLETED

\* FAILED



business corrections must be represented by a new Business Transaction (for example, refund, reversal, cancellation), not by an Override.



\---



\# Relationship to Decision



The original Decision remains authoritative as the policy evaluation result.



The Override represents an explicit business exception.



Example:



```text

Decision



REJECTED



↓



Override



APPROVED

```



Both are permanently preserved.



\---



\# Relationship to Execution



Execution proceeds using the effective decision:



\* Original Decision, or

\* Active Override



The original Decision is never removed.



\---



\# Relationship to Replay



Replay always reproduces:



\* Original Decision

\* Override History



Replay never recreates or changes Overrides.



\---



\# Relationship to Verification



Verification validates:



\* Override integrity

\* Override identity

\* Override timestamps

\* Override linkage to the Business Transaction



Verification does not determine whether the Override was an appropriate business decision.



\---



\# Relationship to the Execution Trust Record



Every Override becomes part of the immutable Execution Trust Record.



```text

Execution Trust Record



├── Decision



├── Override History



└── Executions

```



\---



\# Failure Conditions



An Override request is rejected if:



\* No Decision exists.

\* Execution has already reached a terminal state.

\* The Business Transaction does not exist.

\* The requester is not authorized (defined by the Authentication \& Authorization Model).



\---



\# Canonical Principles



\## Principle 1

\---

Overrides never replace the original Decision.



\---



\## Principle 3

\---



\## Principle 4



Override history is append-only.



\---



\## Principle 5



Only one Override may be active at any time.



\---



\## Principle 6



Overrides cannot occur after Execution has completed or failed.



\---



\## Principle 7



Business corrections after completed execution require a new Business Transaction.

\# Summary



The Override Model provides a controlled mechanism for handling exceptional business situations where a rejected policy Decision must be superseded by an authorized human decision.



Overrides preserve the original Decision, create an immutable append-only history, and ensure that every exception remains permanently recorded within the Execution Trust Record, maintaining complete auditability and deterministic replay.
