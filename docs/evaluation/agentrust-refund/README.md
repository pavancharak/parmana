# Refund scenario: a reproducible evaluation package

A test package for one scenario, `paytm:refund` under the policy `customer-refund` 1.2.0, prepared for a proposal
to the AgenTrust integrations repository. It runs three cases through Parmana's real `POST /execute` path and
records, for each one, the decision, the signed record and how many times the connector was invoked.

## What it shows, and what it does not

- **Connector invocations are counted per case.** A refused request must reach the connector zero times.
- **Every connector result is a mock result.** The connector is `MockPaytmConnectorServer`, a hermetic stand in for
  the Paytm connector service. Nothing in this package confirms a refund at Paytm or any other downstream system.
  The report labels each result accordingly.
- **Two of the policy's facts come from the caller.** `refundEligible` and `fraudCheckPassed` are declared by the
  caller and are not checked against an order system or a fraud system. In this policy they can only cause a
  refusal; the signed manager approval is what authorizes a refund. Every case sets both to `true`, so the outcome
  is decided by the approval alone.
- **Server side enforcement, not only signatures.** The refusals are decided by the server (policy, approval
  verification, single use). The signed records are evidence of those decisions that can be checked afterwards;
  they do not by themselves prevent anything.

## Run it

Requirements: Node.js 24, git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pavancharak/parmana.git
cd parmana
git checkout <commit named in report.json>
npm ci
npm run build
npm run evaluate:agentrust-refund
```

The command runs `packages/api/tests/integration/agentrust-refund-evaluation.integration.test.ts`, then writes
`evaluations/agentrust-refund/report.json` with the commit, whether the working tree was clean, the Node.js version
and the cases. It also writes the full signed records to `evaluations/agentrust-refund/fixtures/`: the
Execution Trust Record, both Refusal Records, the signed manager approval, Parmana's signing key as `GET /keys/default`
serves it and the approver's public key. Each run makes new keys and identifiers, so it replaces every fixture. It needs no network, database, keys or accounts: storage is in memory, the approver key is generated
for the run, and the connector is the mock.

## The three cases and the expected outcomes

| Case             | Request                                                                            | Expected HTTP       | Decision | Connector invocations | Signed record                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `valid-approval` | Refund of 500 for `order-eval-1`, with a manager approval for that order up to 500 | 200                 | APPROVED | 1 (mock result)       | Execution Trust Record, Ed25519, with the policy content hash                                                                     |
| `refusal`        | Refund of 500 for `order-eval-2`, every caller fact `true`, no approval            | 403 `POLICY_DENIED` | REFUSED  | 0                     | Refusal Record, Ed25519, same policy content hash, verified by `POST /refusal/verify`; rule `signal-state-verification-violation` |
| `replay`         | The approval from `valid-approval`, sent again with a new request                  | 403 `POLICY_DENIED` | REFUSED  | 0                     | Refusal Record, as above; reason: the approval was already used, so it verifies as `managerApproved=false`                        |

The test fails if any of these does not hold, including if the connector is invoked more than once in total.

## Mapping to TRACE

TRACE v0.2 (`agentrust-trace` 0.11.0, `TrustRecord`) asks for evidence about one agent execution. Parmana produces
evidence about one decision and, when approved, one connector invocation. The mapping below says, field by field,
what Parmana can supply, and marks what it cannot. It is a proposal to agree with a maintainer, not an
implementation.

| TRACE field                  | From Parmana                                                                                                                                | Status                                                        |

Questions for the maintainer before implementing:

1. Is one TRACE record per Parmana decision the right unit, including refusals with `call_count: 0`?
2. Which `subject`, `model` and `data_class` should an adapter use when the governance layer does not see them?
3. Should the TRACE record be signed by an adapter key and reference the Parmana record, or should Parmana sign the
   TRACE form itself?
4. How should a mock connector result be marked in a TRACE record, so it is never read as a confirmed action?
