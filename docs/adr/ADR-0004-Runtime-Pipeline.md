\# ADR-0004 — Runtime Pipeline



\*\*Status:\*\* Accepted



\*\*Date:\*\* 2026-06-25



\*\*Decision Makers:\*\* Parmana Architecture Team



\---



\# Context



The Runtime is responsible for orchestrating execution.



A design decision was required regarding how execution logic should be organized.



Several alternatives were considered:



\* A single monolithic Runtime class.

\* Event-driven orchestration.

\* Workflow graphs.

\* Sequential execution pipeline.



The architecture needed to satisfy the following requirements:



\* Deterministic execution.

\* Simple reasoning.

\* Independent execution stages.

\* Extensibility.

\* Replay compatibility.

\* Testability.



\---



\# Decision



The Runtime SHALL be implemented as a deterministic execution pipeline.



Execution SHALL be performed by a sequence of independent Runtime Components.



Each component receives an immutable `ExecutionTransaction` and returns a new immutable `ExecutionTransaction`.



The Runtime itself SHALL coordinate the pipeline but SHALL NOT contain business logic.

&#x20;     ├── ExecutionStage

&#x20;     └── EvidenceStage

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Completed ExecutionTransaction

```



Each stage has a single responsibility.



\---



\# Runtime Component Contract



Every stage SHALL implement a common contract.



```typescript

interface RuntimeComponent {

&#x20; execute(

&#x20;   transaction: ExecutionTransaction

&#x20; ): ExecutionTransaction;

}

```



This enables composition while keeping stages independent.



\---



\# Stage Responsibilities



\## AuthorityStage



Records or validates the authority responsible for initiating execution.



Produces:



\* Authority



\---



\## IntentStage



Captures the intended action.



Produces:



\* Intent



\---



\## AuthorizationStage



Evaluates whether execution is permitted.



Produces:



\* Authorization



This stage does not perform execution.



\---



\## ExecutionStage



Coordinates execution.



Produces:



\* Execution



Execution records factual outcomes only.



\---



\## EvidenceStage



Generates immutable execution evidence.



Produces:



\* Evidence



Evidence becomes the input to the Verification Engine.



\---



\# Design Principles



Every Runtime Component SHALL be:



\* Deterministic

\* Stateless where practical

\* Independently testable

\* Composable

\* Side-effect aware



Components SHALL avoid hidden dependencies on other stages.



\---



\# Execution Flow



```text

ExecutionTransaction

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

AuthorityStage

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

IntentStage

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

AuthorizationStage

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

ExecutionStage

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

EvidenceStage

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Completed ExecutionTransaction

```



Each stage transforms the transaction without mutating the previous instance.



\---



\# Consequences



\## Positive



\* Clear separation of concerns.

\* Simple execution model.

\* High testability.

\* Easy extension.

\* Predictable execution order.

\* Deterministic replay.

\* Reusable pipeline components.



\---



\## Negative



\* More classes than a monolithic Runtime.

\* Additional object allocation.

\* Pipeline ordering must be managed explicitly.



These trade-offs are acceptable because they improve maintainability and preserve deterministic behavior.



\---



\# Rejected Alternatives



\## Monolithic Runtime



Rejected because execution logic would become tightly coupled, difficult to test, and harder to extend.



\---



\## Event-Driven Runtime



Rejected because asynchronous event ordering can complicate deterministic replay and increase implementation complexity.



\---



\## Workflow Graph



Rejected because graph-based execution introduces unnecessary flexibility for the canonical execution lifecycle and makes deterministic reasoning more difficult.



\---



\# Relationship to Verification



The Runtime Pipeline is responsible only for producing a complete immutable `ExecutionTransaction`.



Verification is intentionally excluded from the pipeline.



```text

Runtime Pipeline

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

ExecutionTransaction

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Verification Engine

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Verification Report

```



This preserves the architectural separation between execution and trust evaluation.



\---



\# Impact



This decision establishes the Runtime as a lightweight orchestration layer composed of deterministic execution stages.



Future stages (for example, `PolicyStage`, `HumanApprovalStage`, or `AttestationStage`) MAY be added without changing the Runtime itself, provided they implement the `RuntimeComponent` contract and preserve deterministic execution.



This pipeline architecture provides a stable foundation for future extensions while maintaining the simplicity and predictability required by the Parmana Execution Trust Model.
