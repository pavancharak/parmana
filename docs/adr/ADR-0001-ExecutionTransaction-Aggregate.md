\# ADR-0001 — ExecutionTransaction as the Aggregate Root



\*\*Status:\*\* Accepted



\*\*Date:\*\* 2026-06-25



\*\*Decision Makers:\*\* Parmana Architecture Team



\---



\# Context



Parmana models an execution as a sequence of immutable facts:



\* Authority

\* Intent

\* Authorization

\* Execution

\* Evidence



A fundamental architectural decision was required:



Should these concepts exist as independent aggregate roots, or should they be owned by a single aggregate?



The answer affects consistency, transaction boundaries, replay, verification, persistence, and API design.



\---



\# Decision



`ExecutionTransaction` SHALL be the sole aggregate root of the Parmana Core domain.



The following objects SHALL be owned by the aggregate:



\* Authority

\* Intent

\* Authorization

\* Execution

\* Evidence



These objects are immutable components of a single execution record.



They SHALL NOT exist independently within the Core domain.



\---



\# Rationale



\## Single Consistency Boundary



Execution represents one logical business event.



All recorded facts belong to the same immutable transaction.



A single aggregate guarantees internal consistency.



\---



\## Immutability



ExecutionTransaction is immutable.



Changes create new aggregate instances rather than modifying existing state.



This simplifies replay, auditing, and deterministic verification.



\---



\## Simplified Persistence



Persisting one aggregate is simpler than coordinating multiple independent aggregates.



Storage implementations only need to manage a single execution record.



\---



\## Replay



Replay operates on one immutable transaction.



No reconstruction from multiple aggregates is required.



\---



\## Verification



Verification consumes a complete execution record.



It does not require fetching related entities or reconstructing domain state.



\---



\## Evidence Ownership



Evidence belongs to a single execution.



Evidence SHALL NOT be shared between transactions.



This preserves isolation and simplifies integrity verification.



\---



\# Consequences



\## Positive



\* Clear transaction boundary.

\* Simpler persistence.

\* Deterministic replay.

\* Independent verification.

\* Easier serialization.

\* Reduced domain complexity.



\---



\## Negative



\* Individual components cannot evolve independently.

\* Large transactions may contain many evidence artifacts.

\* Partial persistence is not supported within the aggregate.



These trade-offs are acceptable because Parmana optimizes for execution integrity rather than object reuse.



\---



\# Rejected Alternatives



\## Independent Aggregates



Each concept represented as its own aggregate.



Rejected because it would require:



\* Cross-aggregate consistency.

\* Complex persistence.

\* Reconstruction during verification.

\* Increased implementation complexity.



\---



\## Mutable Aggregate



ExecutionTransaction updated in place.



Rejected because mutable state conflicts with deterministic replay, immutable evidence, and trust verification.



\---



\# Relationship to Verification



Verification is \*\*not\*\* part of the aggregate.



Verification is a derived projection.



```text

ExecutionTransaction

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Verification Engine

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Verification Report

```



The aggregate records facts.



The Verification Engine evaluates those facts.



\---



\# Architectural Invariants



The following invariants SHALL always hold:



\* Every ExecutionTransaction has exactly one Authority.

\* Every ExecutionTransaction has exactly one Intent.

\* Every ExecutionTransaction has exactly one Authorization.

\* Every ExecutionTransaction has exactly one Execution.

\* Every ExecutionTransaction owns its Evidence.

\* Verification never modifies the aggregate.

\* The aggregate remains immutable.



\---



\# Impact



This decision establishes the canonical transaction boundary for Parmana.



All Runtime, Verification, Storage, SDK, API, and CLI implementations SHALL treat `ExecutionTransaction` as the authoritative representation of a single execution.



Future packages MUST preserve this aggregate boundary unless superseded by a future ADR.
