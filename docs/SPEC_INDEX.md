\# Parmana Specification Index



\*\*Project:\*\* Parmana — Execution Trust Infrastructure



\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Architecture Locked



\---



\# Overview



This specification defines the architecture, domain model, implementation contracts, and engineering principles of the Parmana platform.



The specification is organized into three layers.



\---



\# Part I — Foundation



These documents define the permanent architecture of Parmana.



They change rarely.



| Document                     | Purpose                                        |

| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |

| 000-CONSTITUTION.md          | Core principles and architectural constitution |

| 001-ARCHITECTURE.md          | Overall platform architecture                  |

| 002-DOMAIN-MODEL.md          | Canonical business domain model                |

| 003-EXECUTION-TRANSACTION.md | Root aggregate specification                   |

| 004-VERIFICATION.md          | Verification model and trust invariants        |



\---



\# Part II — Platform Contracts



These documents define the public interfaces of the platform.



| Document            | Purpose                                |

| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |

| 006-API.md          | Public REST API specification          |

| 007-SDK.md          | SDK architecture                       |

| 008-CLI.md          | Command-line interface                 |



\---



\# Part III — Runtime Contracts



These documents define execution behavior.



| Document        | Purpose                             |

| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |

| 009-STORAGE.md  | Storage abstraction and persistence |

| 010-EVIDENCE.md | Evidence architecture               |

| 011-RUNTIME.md  | Runtime orchestration               |

\# Canonical Execution Lifecycle



```text

Authority

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Intent

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Authorization

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Execution

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Evidence

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Verification

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Execution Trust

```



Every ExecutionTransaction follows this lifecycle.



\---



\# Core Domains



The platform defines six canonical business domains.



\* Authority

\* Intent

\* Authorization

\* Execution

\* Evidence

\* Verification



These domains are owned by the ExecutionTransaction aggregate.



\---



\# Architectural Layers



```text

Applications

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

SDK / CLI / API

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Runtime

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Evidence

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Verification

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Storage + Crypto

```



Each layer has a single responsibility.



\---



\# Guiding Principles



\* ExecutionTransaction is the root aggregate.

\* Evidence is immutable and append-only.

\* Verification is deterministic and reproducible.

\* Trust is established through verification.

\* Cryptography is replaceable.

\* Storage is implementation-independent.

\* Business domains are independent of infrastructure.

\# Implementation Order



Implementation follows the specification.



\### Phase 1



Shared domain model



\* ExecutionTransaction

\* Authority

\* Intent

\* Authorization

\* Execution

\* Evidence

\* Verification



\---



\### Phase 2



Crypto layer



Storage layer



Evidence layer



\---



\### Phase 3



Runtime



Verification Engine



Trust Report



\---



\### Phase 4



SDK



REST API



CLI



Examples



\---



\# Success Criteria



The Parmana platform is complete when:



\* Every execution is represented by an ExecutionTransaction.

\* Every execution produces immutable Evidence.

\* Every execution can be independently Verified.

\* Every verification produces an Execution Trust Report.

\* The platform remains independent of specific storage technologies and cryptographic algorithms.
