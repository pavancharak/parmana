\# Parmana Architecture



\*\*Document:\*\* 001-ARCHITECTURE.md

\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0.0 (Draft)

\*\*Status:\*\* Architecture Lock



\---



\# Purpose



This document defines the canonical architecture of the Parmana platform.



It specifies the permanent architectural structure that all implementations, APIs, SDKs, services, and integrations must follow.



Implementation details may evolve.



The architecture defined here is intended to remain stable.



\---



\# Platform Overview



Parmana is \*\*Execution Trust Infrastructure\*\*.



The platform establishes a verifiable chain from authority to execution, producing evidence that allows independent verification that execution matched authorized intent.

The architecture consists of three platform pillars built around a single execution transaction.



\---



\# Platform Pillars



\## 1. Runtime



Purpose:



Create trusted execution.



Responsibilities:



\* Capture Authority

\* Create Intent

\* Evaluate Authorization

\* Record Execution



The Runtime is responsible for executing work.



It does not establish trust.



\---



\## 2. Evidence



Purpose:



Preserve immutable evidence.



Responsibilities:



\* Record execution evidence

\* Produce attestations

\* Produce receipts

\* Store signatures

\* Store hashes

\* Maintain ledger records



Evidence is append-only.



Evidence never mutates.



\---



\## 3. Verification



Purpose:



Establish execution trust.



Responsibilities:



\* Replay evidence

\* Verify integrity

\* Verify authorization

\* Verify execution

\* Produce trust reports



Verification never depends solely on runtime state.



Verification depends on recorded evidence.



\---



\# Canonical Lifecycle



Every execution follows the same lifecycle.



```

Authority

&#x20;   ↓

Intent

&#x20;   ↓

Authorization

&#x20;   ↓

Execution

&#x20;   ↓

Evidence

&#x20;   ↓

Verification

&#x20;   ↓

Execution Trust

```



Every execution in the platform follows this lifecycle.



\---



\# Execution Transaction



The ExecutionTransaction is the root aggregate of the platform.



Every platform capability is associated with an ExecutionTransaction.



```

ExecutionTransaction



├── Authority



├── Intent



├── Authorization



├── Execution



├── Evidence



└── Verification

```



No execution exists outside an ExecutionTransaction.



\---



\# Runtime Domains



Runtime consists of four canonical domains.



\## Authority



Identifies who is permitted to authorize execution.



\---



\## Intent



Defines what execution is expected to perform.



Intent is immutable.



\---



\## Authorization



Determines whether execution is permitted.



Authorization evaluates policy and produces authorization artifacts.



\---



\## Execution



Records what actually occurred.



Execution is immutable.



\---



\# Evidence Domain



Evidence preserves every artifact required for independent verification.



Evidence may include:



\* Signals

\* Attestations

\* Receipts

\* Hashes

\* Signatures

\* Ledger Records

\* Policy Snapshots



These are implementation artifacts.



They are not top-level platform domains.



\---



\# Verification Domain



Verification establishes execution trust.



Verification consumes evidence.



Verification never consumes mutable runtime state.



Verification evaluates platform invariants.



Verification produces:



\* Verification Result

\* Trust Report

\* Replay Result

\* Integrity Result



\---



\# Platform Invariants



The architecture guarantees six invariants.



| Domain        | Invariant                                         |

| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |

| Authority     | Execution originates from a recognized authority. |

| Intent        | Execution matches immutable intent.               |

| Authorization | Execution is policy authorized.                   |

| Execution     | Execution is permanently recorded.                |

| Evidence      | Evidence is independently verifiable.             |

| Verification  | Execution matches authorized intent.              |



Every platform capability strengthens one or more invariants.



\---



\# Cryptographic Layer



Cryptography is an infrastructure capability.



It is not a platform domain.



The platform supports cryptographic agility through Crypto Profiles.



A Crypto Profile specifies:



\* Canonicalization

\* Hash Algorithm

\* Signature Algorithm

\* Key Identifier

\* Version



Future cryptographic algorithms must not require architectural changes.



\---



\# Trust Report



The Trust Report is the primary human-readable artifact produced by the platform.



It summarizes:



\* Authority Verification

\* Intent Verification

\* Authorization Verification

\* Execution Verification

\* Evidence Verification

\* Integrity Verification



The Trust Report represents the outcome of verification.



\---



\# Package Architecture



```

packages/



runtime/



evidence/



verification/



crypto/



shared/

```



Responsibilities:



\*\*runtime\*\*



Execution lifecycle.



\*\*evidence\*\*



Immutable evidence generation and storage.



\*\*verification\*\*



Replay, invariant evaluation, and trust reporting.



\*\*crypto\*\*



Cryptographic providers and algorithm implementations.



\*\*shared\*\*



Shared domain models and platform contracts.



\---



\# Dependency Rules



Dependencies flow in one direction.



```

Runtime

&#x20;     ↓



Evidence

&#x20;     ↓



Verification

&#x20;     ↓



Trust Report

```



Verification depends on Runtime only through recorded evidence.



Runtime must never depend on Verification.



Crypto provides services to all layers but owns no business logic.



\---



\# Architectural Principles



1\. ExecutionTransaction is the root aggregate.

2\. Runtime creates execution.

3\. Evidence preserves execution.

4\. Verification establishes execution trust.

5\. Evidence is immutable.

6\. Verification is deterministic.

7\. Cryptography is replaceable.

8\. Business domains are independent of cryptographic algorithms.



\---



\# Success Criterion



The architecture succeeds when an independent verifier can determine, using recorded evidence alone, whether execution matched authorized intent without requiring access to the original runtime.
