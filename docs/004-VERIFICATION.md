\# Verification Specification



\*\*Document:\*\* 004-VERIFICATION.md

\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0.0 (Draft)

\*\*Status:\*\* Architecture Lock



\---



\# Purpose



Verification is the process of independently determining whether an execution matched its authorized intent.



Verification establishes \*\*Execution Trust\*\*.



Verification does not create trust.



Verification produces evidence that allows trust to be independently established.



\---



\# Definition



Verification is a deterministic evaluation performed against an immutable ExecutionTransaction.



Verification consumes recorded evidence.



Verification never depends solely on runtime state.



\---



\# Verification Philosophy



Runtime performs execution.



Evidence preserves execution.



Verification evaluates execution.



These responsibilities remain permanently separated.



\---



\# Inputs



Verification operates on exactly one ExecutionTransaction.



It consumes:



```text

Authority



Intent



Authorization



Execution



Evidence

```



Verification never modifies these objects.



\---



\# Output



Verification produces one immutable Verification Report.



Possible outcomes:



```text

PASS



FAIL



INCOMPLETE



UNKNOWN

```



Verification is binary.



Trust is never represented as a percentage.



\---

\# Platform Invariants



Verification evaluates six platform invariants.



\---



\## Invariant 1



\### Authority



Question



Who authorized execution?



Verification confirms:



\* Authority exists

\* Authority identity is valid

\* Authority was authorized to approve execution



Result



PASS or FAIL



\---



\## Invariant 2



\### Intent



Question



What was supposed to happen?



Verification confirms:



\* Intent exists

\* Intent is immutable

\* Intent uniquely identifies expected execution



Result



PASS or FAIL



\---



\## Invariant 3



\### Authorization



Question



Was execution permitted?



Verification confirms:



\* Authorization exists

\* Authorization references Intent

\* Policy evaluation succeeded

\* Authorization preceded execution



Result



PASS or FAIL



\---



\## Invariant 4



\### Execution



Question



What actually happened?



Verification confirms:



\* Execution exists

\* Execution completed

\* Execution references Authorization



Result



PASS or FAIL



\---



\## Invariant 5



\### Evidence



Question



Can execution be independently proven?



Verification confirms:



\* Evidence exists

\* Required artifacts exist

\* Signatures validate

\* Hashes validate

\* Ledger integrity is preserved



Result



PASS or FAIL



\---



\## Invariant 6



\### Integrity



Question



Did execution match authorized intent?



Verification confirms:



\* Execution matches Intent

\* Authorization matches Execution

\* Evidence matches Execution

\* No integrity violations exist



Result



PASS or FAIL

\# Verification Engine



Responsibilities



\* Load ExecutionTransaction

\* Evaluate invariants

\* Produce immutable report



The engine does not:



\* modify execution

\* execute policy

\* create evidence



\---



\# Verification Report



Every verification produces exactly one report.



Example



```text

Execution Transaction



txn\_01...



\------------------------------------



Authority



PASS



Intent



PASS



Authorization



PASS



Execution



PASS



Evidence



PASS



Integrity



PASS



\------------------------------------



Overall Result



PASS

```



The report is immutable.



\---



\# Replay



Verification must be reproducible.



Given identical inputs,



Verification must always produce identical outputs.



Replay depends only on:



\* ExecutionTransaction

\* Evidence

\* Applicable Crypto Profile

\* Verification Specification Version



Replay never depends on transient runtime state.



\---



\# Cryptographic Verification



Verification delegates cryptographic operations to the crypto layer.



Verification never embeds specific algorithms.



Supported operations include:



\* Signature Verification

\* Hash Verification

\* Canonicalization Verification



Algorithm selection is determined by the associated Crypto Profile.



\---



\# Failure Handling



Verification failures do not modify execution.



Failures produce immutable reports.



Possible failure reasons include:



\* Missing Evidence

\* Invalid Signature

\* Hash Mismatch

\* Policy Violation

\* Intent Mismatch

\* Authorization Missing

\* Integrity Failure



\---



\# Architectural Constraints



Verification:



\* is deterministic

\* is reproducible

\* is side-effect free

\* is independent of runtime

\* depends only on immutable evidence

\* is cryptographically agile



\---



\# Future Compatibility



The Verification Engine must remain compatible with:



\* new execution engines

\* new policy engines

\* new evidence types

\* new cryptographic algorithms

\* post-quantum cryptography



Verification logic must remain stable even when infrastructure evolves.



\---



\# Success Criterion



Verification succeeds when an independent verifier can determine, using recorded evidence alone, whether execution matched authorized intent and reproduce the same result without relying on the original runtime environment.
