\# Evidence Specification



\*\*Document:\*\* 010-EVIDENCE.md

\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0.0 (Draft)

\*\*Status:\*\* Implementation Specification



\---



\# Purpose



This document defines the Evidence architecture of the Parmana platform.



Evidence is the permanent, immutable record of an ExecutionTransaction.



Evidence enables independent verification.



Without evidence there is no Execution Trust.



\---



\# Evidence Philosophy



Execution is temporary.



Evidence is permanent.



Evidence is the source of truth used for verification.



Evidence is not generated for debugging.



Evidence is generated to establish trust.



\---



\# Design Principles



Evidence must be:



\* Immutable

\* Append-only

\* Deterministic

\* Verifiable

\* Replayable

\* Cryptographically protected

\* Technology independent



\---



\# Evidence Model



Evidence belongs to exactly one ExecutionTransaction.

```



Evidence is a collection of immutable artifacts.

Evidence is complete only after persistence.



\---



\# Evidence Categories



\## Signals



Input observations used during execution.



Examples:



\* User input

\* Agent state

\* Context snapshot

\* External events



Signals are factual observations.



Signals are never modified.



\---



\## Decision Record



Records the authorization outcome.



May include:



\* Decision Identifier

\* Decision Result

\* Decision Timestamp

\* Decision Metadata



Decision Records belong to the Authorization domain but are stored as Evidence.



\---



\## Policy Snapshot



Preserves the exact policy evaluated during authorization.



Policy Snapshots are immutable.



Future policy changes do not modify historical evidence.



\---



\## Attestation



Records assertions made during execution.



Examples:



\* Execution started

\* Execution completed

\* External confirmation



Attestations are append-only.



\---



\## Receipt



Represents cryptographic proof that evidence has been accepted and recorded.



Receipts include:



\* Receipt Identifier

\* Timestamp

\* Evidence Reference

\* Integrity Metadata



Receipts never change.



\---



\## Hashes



Provide integrity verification.



Each hash records:



\* Algorithm

\* Value

\* Canonicalization Version



Multiple hashes may coexist to support algorithm migration.



\---



\## Signatures



Provide authenticity.



Each signature records:



\* Algorithm

\* Key Identifier

\* Signature Value

\* Timestamp



Multiple signatures may coexist to support hybrid cryptography.



\---



\## Ledger Reference



Optionally links evidence to an external append-only ledger.



Ledger integration is implementation-specific.



The domain model remains unchanged.



\---



\## Metadata



Stores operational information.



Examples:



\* Correlation ID

\* Tenant ID

\* Labels

\* Tags



Metadata must never alter evidence semantics.



\---



\# Evidence Rules



Evidence is:



\* Immutable

\* Append-only

\* Timestamped

\* Versioned

\* Traceable



Evidence is never edited.



Corrections produce additional evidence.



\---



\# Evidence Relationships



Every evidence artifact references:



\* ExecutionTransaction

\* Artifact Type

\* Created Timestamp

\* Crypto Profile Reference

\* Evidence Version



No evidence artifact exists without an ExecutionTransaction.



\---



\# Integrity Requirements



Every evidence artifact supports:



\* Canonicalization

\* Hash Verification

\* Signature Verification

\* Provenance

\* Replay



Integrity is evaluated by the Verification Engine.



Evidence does not verify itself.



\---



\# Cryptographic Independence



Evidence records cryptographic metadata.



Evidence does not implement cryptographic algorithms.



Algorithm selection belongs to the Crypto layer.



\---



\# Replay Requirements



Evidence must preserve sufficient information to reconstruct the execution environment required for deterministic verification.



Replay depends only on recorded evidence.



Replay never depends on runtime memory.



\---



\# Evolution



New evidence types may be introduced.



Existing evidence types remain valid.



Historical evidence is never rewritten to match newer formats.



Transformation creates new evidence while preserving the original.



\---



\# Dependency Rules

&#x20;     ▼

Verification

```



Evidence does not depend on Verification.



Verification depends on Evidence.

\# Package Structure

&#x20;   signals/



&#x20;   decisions/



&#x20;   policies/



&#x20;   attestations/



&#x20;   receipts/



&#x20;   hashes/



&#x20;   signatures/



&#x20;   ledger/



&#x20;   metadata/

```



Each evidence type owns its own implementation.



The Evidence domain provides the common abstraction.



\---



\# Success Criterion



The Evidence architecture succeeds when an independent verifier can reconstruct the complete factual record of an ExecutionTransaction, validate its integrity and authenticity, and reproduce the verification outcome without requiring access to the original runtime or application.
