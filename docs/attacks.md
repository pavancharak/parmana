# Part 1: Seven Ways AI Commits Payment Fraud

Six of these are actively simulated in this lab by seven bounded agents
(`src/fraud_agents.py`), four of them making real OpenAI API calls, two
of them (Agents 3 and 7) attacking our own trained detector directly
rather than any external system. One is documented honestly as a known
gap, a real attack path this lab does not generate traffic for, listed
so judges see the boundary of what was actually tested versus what is
future work.

## 1. AI Fabricated Identity, *simulated, real OpenAI calls*
**Where:** Account creation / onboarding.
**Needs:** A generative model, a few real customer profiles to imitate, an
open signup path.
**Why it's hard to catch:** Each transaction looks statistically normal
because the AI copies real spending shape. There's no history to compare
against on transaction #1.
**Damage:** New account fraud, promo abuse, mule accounts.
**Agent:** `agent1_fake_identity`, GPT-4o-mini generates each identity.

## 2. Spending Pattern Replication (Card Testing & Draining), *simulated*
**Where:** Authorization / payment processing.
**Needs:** A stolen card/token and a generator that mimics the
cardholder's usual amount/merchant/timing shape at machine speed.
**Why it's hard to catch:** Amounts and merchants resemble genuine
history; the anomaly is velocity and cumulative volume, visible only in
aggregate.
**Damage:** Direct monetary loss, chargebacks, network penalties.
**Agent:** `agent5_pattern_replicator`, local/statistical by design:
amounts should follow the real distribution being copied, not creative
LLM text.

## 3. Payment Form / API Fuzzing, *simulated*
**Where:** Client input into backend processing.
**Needs:** Knowledge of the form/API schema and an automated fuzzer.
**Why it's hard to catch:** Loud individually, but used as reconnaissance.
The one field that doesn't reject cleanly becomes tomorrow's entry
point.
**Damage:** Crashes, injection vulnerabilities, a discovered bypass used
later.
**Agent:** `agent6_injection_generator`, known public payloads, no LLM
needed.

## 4. AI Voice/Chat Social Engineering, *simulated, real OpenAI calls (text only)*
**Where:** Customer authentication via call center or chat support.
**Needs:** Voice cloning or a conversational model plus leaked personal
data about the victim.
**Why it's hard to catch:** Convincing enough to pass authentication
questions based on personal knowledge.
**Damage:** Account takeover, unauthorized card issuance, disabled fraud
alerts.
**Agent:** `agent2_social_engineer`, GPT-4o-mini generates fictional
call-center transcripts. Text only: no voice cloning, no audio, no real
support line contacted.

## 5. Authorization Limit Probing, *simulated, real: attacks our own detector*
**Where:** Authorization.
**Needs:** A stolen card and a script submitting many small transactions
across merchants to map fraud thresholds before one large charge.
**Why it's hard to catch:** Each probe sits under thresholds set per
transaction; only visible when correlated across merchants.
**Damage:** Reveals defenders' thresholds, exploited in a precisely sized
charge that follows.
**Agent:** `agent3_limit_prober`, runs after the detector is trained (see
`probe_detector.py`) and submits real amounts from $10 to $10,000 through
the actual model, no fabricated external API. Results are on the Red
Team tab.

## 6. AI Generated KYC Document Forgery, *simulated, real OpenAI calls (metadata only)*
**Where:** Identity verification (KYC).
**Needs:** An image generation model producing plausible ID documents or
selfies that pass liveness/document checks.
**Why it's hard to catch:** Can be tuned to defeat the exact verification
model in use, given query access.
**Damage:** Bypasses KYC entirely; enables fully synthetic identities.
**Agent:** `agent4_kyc_forger`, GPT-4o-mini generates identity metadata
bundles (name, DOB, address, occupation), no document images, then our
own detector scores them.

## 7. Feedback Loop Poisoning of the Fraud Model, *not simulated (known gap)*
**Where:** Post decision, dispute/chargeback feedback ingestion.
**Needs:** Repeated small transactions plus false dispute signals meant to
teach a retraining pipeline that fraud patterns are normal.
**Why it's hard to catch:** Attacks the training data, not the
transaction. The model's own confidence goes up, not down.
**Damage:** Long term degradation of detection accuracy.
**Note:** `agent7_feedback_loop` is related but distinct, it generates
real-time evasion variants against the already-trained model (see the
Red Team tab), it does not poison a retraining pipeline. Actually
poisoning a feedback loop would require a persistent retraining process
this lab doesn't run, so this attack stays an honest gap.
