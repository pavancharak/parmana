\# Runtime Stages Architecture



The Runtime itself is intentionally small.



Its responsibility is to coordinate execution, not to implement business logic.



Business behavior is implemented as a sequence of deterministic stages that transform an `ExecutionTransaction`.



Each stage has one responsibility and produces a new immutable transaction. No stage mutates the existing transaction or depends on infrastructure-specific implementations.



\## Runtime Pipeline

&#x20;     ├── IntentStage

&#x20;     ├── AuthorizationStage

&#x20;     ├── ExecutionStage

&#x20;     └── EvidenceStage

```



The pipeline executes stages in order.



Each stage receives an immutable `ExecutionTransaction` and returns a new `ExecutionTransaction`.



\## Stage Responsibilities



\### AuthorityStage



Responsible for establishing the authority associated with the execution.



Produces:



\* Authority



Does not perform policy evaluation.



\---



\### IntentStage



Responsible for recording the intended action.



Produces:



\* Intent



Intent is immutable once recorded.



\---



\### AuthorizationStage



Responsible for evaluating whether execution is permitted.



Produces:



\* Authorization



Authorization determines whether execution may continue.



It does not execute the action.



\---



\### ExecutionStage



Responsible for coordinating execution.



Produces:



\* Execution



Execution records factual outcomes only.



\---



\### EvidenceStage



Responsible for generating immutable evidence.



Produces:



\* Evidence



Evidence becomes the factual record consumed by the Verification Engine.



\---



\## Pipeline Contract



Every stage implements the same interface.



```typescript

interface RuntimeComponent {

&#x20; execute(

&#x20;   transaction: ExecutionTransaction

&#x20; ): ExecutionTransaction;

}

```



Stages must satisfy the following rules:



\* Deterministic

\* Immutable

\* Idempotent where applicable

\* Independent

\* Composable



Stages never mutate the incoming transaction.



Stages never perform verification.



Stages never depend on storage implementations.



\## Execution Flow

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

&#x20;       ▼

EvidenceStage

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Completed ExecutionTransaction

```



The Runtime completes when the transaction has been transformed into a complete execution record containing Authority, Intent, Authorization, Execution, and Evidence.



Verification is performed afterwards by the Verification Engine.
