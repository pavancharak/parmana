\# RFC-0002 — Replay Engine



\*\*Status:\*\* Draft



\*\*Author:\*\* Parmana Architecture Team



\*\*Created:\*\* 2026-06-25



\*\*Target Version:\*\* 0.2.0



\---



\# Summary



Introduce a Replay Engine capable of deterministically reconstructing an execution from an immutable `ExecutionTransaction` and its associated evidence.



The Replay Engine validates that the recorded execution can be reproduced from preserved execution artifacts.



Replay is independent of Runtime execution and independent of the Verification Engine.



\---



\# Motivation



Execution Trust requires more than recording execution.



It must be possible to demonstrate that the recorded execution is reproducible using the preserved execution context and evidence.



Replay enables:



\* Independent validation

\* Audit

\* Incident investigation

\* Regression testing

\* Compliance

\* Long-term execution preservation



\---



\# Goals



\* Deterministically reconstruct execution.

\* Validate execution consistency.

\* Operate independently of Runtime.

\* Operate independently of Verification.

\* Produce immutable Replay Reports.



\---



\# Non-Goals



This RFC does not define:



\* Business workflow execution.

\* Live orchestration.

\* Scheduling.

\* State mutation.

\* Distributed execution.



Replay never replaces Runtime.



\---

Replay Report

```



Replay reconstructs execution semantics without invoking production workflows.



\---



\# Responsibilities



The Replay Engine SHALL:



\* Load immutable execution records.

\* Load immutable evidence.

\* Reconstruct execution context.

\* Replay execution deterministically.

\* Detect inconsistencies.

\* Produce Replay Reports.



The Replay Engine SHALL NOT:



\* Execute business logic.

\* Modify transactions.

\* Modify evidence.

\* Authorize execution.

\* Produce new execution artifacts.



\---



\# Replay Inputs



Replay consumes:



\* ExecutionTransaction

\* Evidence

\* Runtime metadata

\* Policy snapshot (if available)

\* Cryptographic metadata



Inputs SHALL remain immutable.



\---



\# Replay Outputs



Replay produces a Replay Report containing:



\* Replay Status

\* Replay Timestamp

\* Execution Consistency

\* Missing Artifacts

\* Replay Messages

\* Metadata



Replay reports are immutable.



\---



\# Replay Pipeline



```text

ExecutionTransaction

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

Load Context

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

Load Evidence

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

Reconstruct Execution

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

Validate Consistency

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

Generate Replay Report

```



Each stage is deterministic.



\---



\# Determinism



Replay SHALL be deterministic.



Equivalent replay inputs SHALL produce equivalent replay results.



Replay SHALL NOT depend upon:



\* Current system time

\* Network availability

\* Random values

\* Runtime state

\* External services



If external dependencies influenced the original execution, their recorded results or preserved context SHALL be used during replay.



\---



\# Relationship to Runtime



```text

Runtime

&#x20;    ▼

ExecutionTransaction

&#x20;    │

&#x20;    ├──────────────┐

&#x20;    ▼              ▼

Replay Engine   Verification Engine

```



Runtime creates execution records.



Replay reconstructs execution.



Verification evaluates trust.



These are independent architectural components.



\---



\# Relationship to Verification



Replay and Verification serve different purposes.



Replay answers:



> Can this execution be reconstructed?



Verification answers:



> Can this execution be trusted?



Replay MAY provide inputs to Verification but SHALL remain an independent subsystem.



\---



\# Replay Report



A Replay Report contains:



\* Overall Status

\* Replay Duration

\* Context Summary

\* Consistency Results

\* Missing Evidence

\* Replay Metadata



Replay Reports never modify the original transaction.



\---



\# Failure Model



Replay failures are explicit.



Typical outcomes include:



\* SUCCESS

\* FAILED

\* INCOMPLETE

\* NOT\_REPLAYABLE



Failures are represented within the Replay Report.



\---



\# Package Mapping



```text

packages/



replay/

&#x20;   src/

&#x20;       ReplayEngine.ts

&#x20;       ReplayPipeline.ts

&#x20;       ReplayReport.ts

&#x20;       ReplayContext.ts

&#x20;       interfaces/

&#x20;           ReplayComponent.ts

&#x20;       components/

&#x20;           ContextLoader.ts

&#x20;           ArtifactLoader.ts

&#x20;           ExecutionReconstructor.ts

&#x20;           ConsistencyValidator.ts

&#x20;           ReplayReporter.ts

```



The Replay package remains independent of Runtime and Verification.



\---



\# Compatibility



This RFC is backward compatible.



Replay is an optional capability.



ExecutionTransactions remain unchanged.



\---



\# Alternatives Considered



\## Replay Inside Runtime



Rejected because Runtime is responsible for execution, not reconstruction.



\---



\## Replay Inside Verification



Rejected because verification evaluates trust, while replay reconstructs execution.



Combining the two would weaken separation of concerns.



\---



\## Runtime Re-Execution



Rejected because re-running business logic may produce different outcomes due to environmental changes.



Replay should reconstruct execution from preserved artifacts rather than execute live systems.



\---



\# Open Questions



\* Should Replay Reports be retained as evidence?

\* Should replay support partial execution reconstruction?

\* Should replay compare multiple executions for behavioral drift?

\* Should replay support historical runtime versions?



\---



\# Acceptance Criteria



\* A `ReplayEngine` abstraction exists.

\* Replay operates independently of Runtime.

\* Replay consumes immutable execution artifacts.

\* Replay produces immutable Replay Reports.

\* Replay is deterministic.

\* Replay does not modify ExecutionTransactions or Evidence.
