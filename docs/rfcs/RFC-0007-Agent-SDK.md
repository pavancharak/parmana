\# RFC-0007 — Agent SDK



\*\*Status:\*\* Draft



\*\*Author:\*\* Parmana Architecture Team



\*\*Created:\*\* 2026-06-25



\*\*Target Version:\*\* 0.4.0



\---



\# Summary



Introduce an Agent SDK that enables autonomous systems to integrate with Parmana and produce verifiable execution records.



The Agent SDK provides a developer-friendly interface for recording authority, intent, authorization, execution, evidence, and verification while remaining independent of any specific AI framework or model provider.



\---



\# Motivation



Modern AI systems increasingly operate as autonomous agents capable of planning, reasoning, invoking tools, and executing actions.



Organizations require evidence that these actions:



\* Were authorized.

\* Matched the intended objective.

\* Produced immutable execution records.

\* Can be independently verified.



The Agent SDK provides this capability without replacing existing agent frameworks.



\---



\# Goals



\* Integrate with existing agent frameworks.

\* Record immutable execution transactions.

\* Preserve deterministic execution semantics.

\* Support replay and verification.

\* Provide a consistent developer experience.



\---



\# Non-Goals



This RFC does not define:



\* An LLM abstraction.

\* Prompt engineering.

\* Agent orchestration.

\* Planning algorithms.

\* Memory systems.

\* Vector databases.

\* Tool execution frameworks.



These remain the responsibility of external agent frameworks.



\---



\# Architectural Principle



The Agent SDK extends autonomous systems with Execution Trust.



It does not replace agent runtimes.

&#x20;                      ▼

&#x20;            ExecutionTransaction

```



The SDK acts as an integration layer between autonomous systems and the Parmana platform.



\---



\# Responsibilities



The Agent SDK SHALL:



\* Create execution transactions.

\* Capture authority and intent.

\* Submit execution requests.

\* Record execution evidence.

\* Invoke verification.

\* Support replay integration.



The Agent SDK SHALL NOT:



\* Execute LLM inference.

\* Manage prompts.

\* Implement planning.

\* Replace orchestration frameworks.



\---



\# Agent Execution Model



A typical execution flow:



```text

Agent Request

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Authority

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Intent

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Authorization

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Execution

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Evidence

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Verification

```



The SDK records each stage as part of the execution lifecycle.



\---



\# Integration Model



The SDK MAY integrate with:



\* Single-agent systems.

\* Multi-agent systems.

\* Human-in-the-loop systems.

\* Workflow engines.

\* Custom automation platforms.



Integration occurs through stable public APIs.



\---



\# Developer API



Illustrative example:



```typescript

const sdk = new AgentSDK();



const transaction = await sdk.execute({

&#x20; authority,

&#x20; intent,

&#x20; execute: async () => {

&#x20;   return toolResult;

&#x20; }

});



const report = await sdk.verify(transaction);

```



The API emphasizes execution recording rather than agent orchestration.



\---



\# Execution Context



The SDK MAY capture contextual information such as:



\* Agent Identifier

\* Session Identifier

\* Tool Invocation Metadata

\* Runtime Configuration

\* Model Metadata

\* Correlation Identifiers



Context is recorded only when relevant to execution trust.



\---



\# Evidence



The SDK records immutable evidence, including:



\* Tool invocations.

\* Execution results.

\* Approval outcomes.

\* Policy decisions.

\* Runtime metadata.



Evidence remains append-only.



\---



\# Verification



The SDK exposes verification capabilities but does not implement verification itself.



Verification is delegated to the Verification Engine.



\---



\# Replay



The SDK MAY expose replay functionality by delegating to the Replay Engine.



Replay remains an independent subsystem.



\---



\# Framework Independence



The Agent SDK SHALL remain independent of any specific:



\* AI model.

\* LLM provider.

\* Agent framework.

\* Workflow engine.

\* Cloud provider.



Framework-specific integrations SHOULD be implemented as adapters.



\---



\# Package Mapping



```text

packages/



sdk/

&#x20;   src/

&#x20;       AgentSDK.ts

&#x20;       AgentBuilder.ts

&#x20;       ExecutionClient.ts

&#x20;       VerificationClient.ts

&#x20;       ReplayClient.ts

&#x20;       adapters/

```



Adapters provide integration with external ecosystems without changing the SDK's public contract.



\---



\# Compatibility



This RFC is backward compatible.



Existing Runtime, Verification, and Replay packages require no architectural changes.



The SDK is an additional integration layer.



\---



\# Alternatives Considered



\## Agent Framework



Rejected because Parmana's purpose is Execution Trust, not agent orchestration.



\---



\## Runtime-Coupled SDK



Rejected because coupling the SDK directly to Runtime internals would reduce portability and hinder future implementations.



\---



\## AI Provider SDK



Rejected because model providers evolve rapidly.



The SDK should remain provider-neutral and focus on execution trust.



\---



\# Open Questions



\* Should streaming tool execution be standardized?

\* Should agent capabilities be discoverable?

\* Should agent identity become a first-class domain concept?

\* Should SDK adapters be maintained within the core repository or separately?



\---



\# Acceptance Criteria



\* An `AgentSDK` abstraction exists.

\* The SDK integrates with Runtime through public APIs.

\* Execution transactions are recorded immutably.

\* Verification and Replay are exposed through client interfaces.

\* The SDK remains independent of AI frameworks and model providers.

\* Existing Core, Runtime, and Verification packages require no architectural changes.
