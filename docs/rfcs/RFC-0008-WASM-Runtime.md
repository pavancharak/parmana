\# RFC-0008 — WASM Runtime



\*\*Status:\*\* Draft



\*\*Author:\*\* Parmana Architecture Team



\*\*Created:\*\* 2026-06-25



\*\*Target Version:\*\* 0.4.0



\---



\# Summary



Introduce a WebAssembly (WASM) Runtime implementation that enables Parmana to execute in portable, sandboxed environments while preserving deterministic execution and execution trust guarantees.



The WASM Runtime is an alternative Runtime implementation and SHALL conform to the Parmana Specification.



\---



\# Motivation



Modern applications increasingly execute at the edge, inside browsers, serverless platforms, embedded systems, and sandboxed execution environments.



WebAssembly provides:



\* Platform independence.

\* Sandboxed execution.

\* Near-native performance.

\* Broad runtime availability.

\* Strong isolation.



A WASM Runtime enables Parmana to execute consistently across these environments.



\---



\# Goals



\* Provide a portable Runtime implementation.

\* Preserve deterministic execution.

\* Support Replay and Verification.

\* Enable edge deployment.

\* Maintain specification conformance.



\---



\# Non-Goals



This RFC does not define:



\* Browser APIs.

\* JavaScript SDKs.

\* Edge platform integrations.

\* WASI extensions.

\* Container orchestration.



These concerns remain implementation specific.



\---



\# Architectural Principle



The Parmana Runtime architecture remains unchanged.



The WASM Runtime is simply another implementation of the Runtime contract.



\---



\# Architecture



```text

&#x20;            Parmana Specification

&#x20;                    │

&#x20;       ┌────────────┼────────────┐

&#x20;       ▼            ▼            ▼

&#x20;Native Runtime  WASM Runtime  Future Runtime

&#x20;       │            │

&#x20;       ▼            ▼

&#x20;ExecutionTransaction

```



All Runtime implementations produce equivalent observable behavior.



\---



\# Runtime Contract



The WASM Runtime SHALL:



\* Execute the Runtime Pipeline.

\* Produce immutable ExecutionTransactions.

\* Generate append-only evidence.

\* Preserve deterministic behavior.



The WASM Runtime SHALL NOT:



\* Modify the Core domain model.

\* Change execution semantics.

\* Introduce platform-specific observable behavior.



\---



\# Execution Model



```text

Application

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

WASM Runtime

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Runtime Pipeline

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

ExecutionTransaction

```



Execution semantics remain identical to the native Runtime.



\---



\# Determinism



Equivalent execution inputs SHALL produce equivalent observable outputs regardless of whether execution occurs in:



\* Native Runtime

\* WASM Runtime



Platform-specific implementation details SHALL NOT influence execution semantics.



\---



\# Runtime Environment



The WASM Runtime MAY execute in:



\* Web browsers.

\* Edge runtimes.

\* Serverless platforms.

\* WASI environments.

\* Embedded systems.

\* Desktop applications.



Deployment environment SHALL NOT affect observable execution behavior.



\---



\# Storage



The WASM Runtime delegates persistence to Storage providers.



Storage implementations MAY differ across environments while preserving the Storage contract.



\---



\# Verification



Execution records produced by the WASM Runtime SHALL be verifiable by any compliant Verification Engine.



Verification remains independent of the Runtime implementation.



\---



\# Replay



Replay SHALL reconstruct executions produced by the WASM Runtime without requiring the original execution environment.



Replay semantics remain identical to native Runtime executions.



\---



\# Security



The WASM Runtime benefits from:



\* Process isolation.

\* Memory isolation.

\* Sandboxed execution.

\* Restricted host access.



Security properties provided by the execution environment complement, but do not replace, Parmana's execution trust guarantees.



\---



\# Performance



The specification imposes no performance requirements.



Implementations MAY optimize:



\* Startup time.

\* Memory usage.

\* Binary size.

\* Throughput.



Optimizations SHALL NOT alter observable execution semantics.



\---



\# Package Mapping



```text

packages/



runtime/

&#x20;   native/



&#x20;   wasm/

&#x20;       WasmRuntime.ts

&#x20;       WasmRuntimeBuilder.ts

&#x20;       WasmPipeline.ts

```



Both implementations conform to the same Runtime interfaces.



\---



\# Compatibility



This RFC is fully backward compatible.



No changes are required to:



\* Core

\* Runtime contracts

\* Verification

\* Replay

\* Storage

\* SDK



The WASM Runtime is an additional implementation.



\---



\# Alternatives Considered



\## Browser-Specific Runtime



Rejected because Parmana should remain deployment-platform independent.



\---



\## JavaScript Runtime



Rejected because JavaScript is a language runtime rather than a portable execution target.



WebAssembly provides broader deployment flexibility.



\---



\## Separate WASM Architecture



Rejected because multiple architectural models would weaken interoperability.



All Runtime implementations should share the same execution semantics.



\---



\# Open Questions



\* Should WASI become the preferred host interface?

\* Should host capability restrictions be standardized?

\* Should deterministic resource limits become part of the Runtime contract?

\* Should precompiled Runtime modules be distributed as release artifacts?



\---



\# Acceptance Criteria



\* A WASM Runtime implementation exists.

\* The Runtime conforms to the existing Runtime contract.

\* Execution semantics match the native Runtime.

\* Verification operates without modification.

\* Replay supports WASM-generated execution records.

\* No Core domain changes are required.
