\# RFC-0009 — Streaming Evidence



\*\*Status:\*\* Draft



\*\*Author:\*\* Parmana Architecture Team



\*\*Created:\*\* 2026-06-25



\*\*Target Version:\*\* 0.4.0



\---



\# Summary



Introduce Streaming Evidence to allow long-running executions to emit immutable evidence artifacts incrementally before execution completes.



Streaming Evidence enables near real-time observability, monitoring, and audit without compromising Parmana's append-only evidence model or deterministic execution guarantees.



The ExecutionTransaction remains the aggregate root. Streaming Evidence extends how evidence is recorded, not how execution is modeled.



\---



\# Motivation



Some executions may last:



\* Minutes

\* Hours

\* Days

\* Weeks



Waiting until completion to record evidence delays:



\* Monitoring

\* Incident response

\* Compliance visibility

\* Human supervision

\* Operational diagnostics



Streaming Evidence allows immutable execution facts to be recorded as they occur.



\---



\# Goals



\* Record evidence incrementally.

\* Preserve append-only semantics.

\* Preserve deterministic replay.

\* Support long-running execution.

\* Enable real-time consumers.



\---



\# Non-Goals



This RFC does not define:



\* Event streaming platforms.

\* Message brokers.

\* Transport protocols.

\* Observability dashboards.

\* Workflow orchestration.



Streaming transport remains implementation specific.



\---



\# Architectural Principle



Execution remains atomic.



Evidence becomes incrementally observable.



Execution semantics remain unchanged.



\---



\# Architecture



```text

ExecutionTransaction

```



Evidence artifacts are appended throughout execution.



\---



\# Evidence Model



Streaming Evidence SHALL consist of immutable Evidence Artifacts.



Each artifact:



\* Represents a factual observation.

\* Is immutable.

\* Is append-only.

\* Has a deterministic order.



Previously emitted artifacts SHALL NOT be modified.



\---



\# Streaming Model



```text

Execution



Artifact 1



Artifact 2



Artifact 3



Artifact 4



Execution Complete

```



Each artifact becomes immediately available after creation.



\---



\# Ordering



Streaming Evidence SHALL preserve logical ordering.



Every artifact SHALL include ordering metadata sufficient to reconstruct the original execution sequence.



Ordering MAY be represented by:



\* Sequence Number

\* Event Index

\* Logical Clock

\* Equivalent deterministic mechanism



\---



\# Runtime Integration



The Runtime MAY emit evidence after each Runtime Stage.



Example:



```text

AuthorityStage

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Evidence



IntentStage

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Evidence



AuthorizationStage

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Evidence



ExecutionStage

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Evidence

```



Streaming is an implementation capability.



The Runtime Pipeline remains unchanged.



\---



\# ExecutionTransaction



ExecutionTransaction SHALL contain the complete ordered evidence collection after execution completes.



Streaming does not alter the final execution record.



\---



\# Verification



The Verification Engine verifies the completed evidence collection.



Verification SHALL NOT require live evidence streaming.



Streaming is an optimization for operational visibility, not a verification requirement.



\---



\# Replay



Replay consumes the completed immutable evidence collection.



Replay MAY reconstruct intermediate execution milestones using streaming order metadata.



Replay SHALL remain deterministic.



\---



\# Subscribers



Implementations MAY expose evidence to subscribers.



Typical consumers include:



\* Monitoring systems.

\* Audit systems.

\* Human approval workflows.

\* Incident response tools.

\* Compliance platforms.



Subscribers SHALL NOT modify evidence.



\---



\# Storage



Storage SHALL preserve:



\* Artifact ordering.

\* Artifact immutability.

\* Append-only semantics.



Storage implementations MAY persist artifacts individually before assembling the final execution record.



\---



\# Package Mapping



```text

packages/



runtime/

&#x20;   streaming/

&#x20;       EvidencePublisher.ts

&#x20;       EvidenceSubscriber.ts

&#x20;       EvidenceStream.ts

```



Streaming components extend Runtime without modifying the Core domain model.



\---



\# Compatibility



This RFC is fully backward compatible.



Implementations that do not support streaming continue to produce identical completed ExecutionTransactions.



Streaming is optional.



\---



\# Alternatives Considered



\## Buffer Until Completion



Rejected because long-running executions benefit from incremental visibility.



\---



\## Mutable Evidence



Rejected because modifying evidence violates append-only semantics and weakens execution trust.



\---



\## Event-Sourced Runtime



Rejected because Parmana records execution evidence rather than treating events as the primary execution model.



ExecutionTransaction remains the aggregate root.



\---



\# Open Questions



\* Should evidence streams support filtering?

\* Should subscribers receive cryptographically signed artifacts?

\* Should evidence batching be standardized?

\* Should streaming back-pressure be part of the Runtime contract?



\---



\# Acceptance Criteria



\* Runtime supports incremental evidence publication.

\* Evidence remains immutable.

\* Evidence remains append-only.

\* ExecutionTransaction contains the complete ordered evidence collection.

\* Verification requires no architectural changes.

\* Replay remains deterministic.
