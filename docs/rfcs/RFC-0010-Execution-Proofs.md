\# RFC-0010 — Execution Proofs



\*\*Status:\*\* Draft



\*\*Author:\*\* Parmana Architecture Team



\*\*Created:\*\* 2026-06-25



\*\*Target Version:\*\* 0.5.0



\---



\# Summary



Introduce \*\*Execution Proofs\*\*, portable cryptographically protected artifacts that enable third parties to independently validate that an execution satisfies the Parmana Execution Trust Model.



Execution Proofs provide a transportable representation of execution trust without requiring direct access to the originating Runtime.



Execution Proofs extend existing execution artifacts and do not replace the ExecutionTransaction.



\---



\# Motivation



ExecutionTrust should be portable.



Organizations increasingly need to demonstrate execution trust across organizational boundaries.



Examples include:



\* Regulatory submissions

\* Customer audits

\* Partner integrations

\* Supply chains

\* Financial systems

\* AI agent ecosystems



Sharing an entire execution database is unnecessary.



Instead, organizations should be able to exchange a compact proof describing the execution.



\---



\# Goals



\* Produce portable trust artifacts.

\* Support independent verification.

\* Preserve cryptographic integrity.

\* Support long-term archival.

\* Avoid Runtime dependencies.



\---



\# Non-Goals



This RFC does not define:



\* Zero-knowledge proofs.

\* Blockchain proofs.

\* Consensus protocols.

\* Formal mathematical proofs.

\* Identity systems.



Execution Proofs are execution trust artifacts.



\---



\# Architectural Principle



Execution Proofs are derived from immutable execution records.



They never replace:



\* ExecutionTransaction

\* Evidence

\* Verification Report



Instead, they summarize and protect trust information.



\---



\# Architecture



```text

ExecutionTransaction

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

Verification Engine

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

Execution Proof Generator

&#x20;         ▼

Execution Proof

&#x20;         │

&#x20;         ▼

External Verifier

```



Execution Proofs are generated after successful verification.



\---



\# Proof Model



An Execution Proof SHALL contain:



\* Proof Identifier

\* Execution Transaction Identifier

\* Verification Status

\* Evidence Digest

\* Cryptographic Metadata

\* Specification Version

\* Generation Timestamp

\* Optional Signature



Execution Proofs are immutable.



\---



\# Evidence Digest



Execution Proofs SHOULD include a digest representing the associated evidence.



The digest enables integrity verification without embedding every evidence artifact.



Evidence remains the authoritative execution record.



\---



\# Proof Generation



Proof generation SHALL occur only after verification completes successfully.



Typical flow:



```text

Execution

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Evidence

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Verification

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Execution Proof

```



Proofs represent verified execution.



\---



\# Verification



Third parties SHALL verify an Execution Proof by validating:



\* Proof integrity.

\* Cryptographic metadata.

\* Evidence digest.

\* Verification metadata.

\* Specification compatibility.



Verification SHALL NOT require access to the originating Runtime.



\---



\# Replay



Replay remains based on the complete ExecutionTransaction.



Execution Proofs are not replay artifacts.



Replay MAY use an Execution Proof to validate integrity before reconstructing execution.



\---



\# Transport



Execution Proofs MAY be exchanged using:



\* Files

\* HTTP APIs

\* Message queues

\* Object storage

\* Email attachments

\* Physical media



The transport mechanism is outside the scope of this RFC.



\---



\# Cryptography



Execution Proofs leverage the provider model defined by the Cryptography package.



Proofs remain algorithm independent.



Historical proofs remain verifiable using the recorded cryptographic metadata.



\---



\# Trust Model



Execution Trust becomes portable.



```text

Execution

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Evidence

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Verification

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Execution Proof

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Independent Trust

```



Trust is derived from immutable execution artifacts rather than assertions.



\---



\# Package Mapping



```text

packages/



proof/

&#x20;   src/

&#x20;       ExecutionProof.ts

&#x20;       ProofGenerator.ts

&#x20;       ProofVerifier.ts

&#x20;       ProofSerializer.ts

```



Execution Proofs form an independent package layered above Verification.



\---



\# Compatibility



This RFC is backward compatible.



Existing Runtime, Verification, Replay, and Storage implementations remain unchanged.



Execution Proofs are an optional capability built on verified execution records.



\---



\# Alternatives Considered



\## Sharing Full Execution Records



Rejected because complete execution records may contain unnecessary operational detail and increase data transfer requirements.



\---



\## Blockchain-Based Proofs



Rejected because Parmana establishes trust through deterministic verification of immutable execution records rather than distributed consensus.



\---



\## Runtime-Generated Proofs



Rejected because proofs should only be generated after successful independent verification.



\---



\# Open Questions



\* Should proof profiles be standardized for different regulatory environments?

\* Should proofs support selective disclosure?

\* Should proofs be time-stamped by external trust services?

\* Should proof expiration policies be standardized?

\* Should proof bundles contain multiple execution proofs?



\---



\# Acceptance Criteria



\* An `ExecutionProof` model exists.

\* Proof generation occurs after successful verification.

\* Proofs are immutable.

\* Proofs support independent verification.

\* Proofs remain cryptographically agile.

\* Runtime and Core packages require no architectural changes.
