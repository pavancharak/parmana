\# RFC-0005 — Distributed Verification



\*\*Status:\*\* Draft



\*\*Author:\*\* Parmana Architecture Team



\*\*Created:\*\* 2026-06-25



\*\*Target Version:\*\* 0.3.0

\# Summary



Introduce a Distributed Verification model that enables multiple independent Verification Engines to evaluate the same immutable execution record and produce independently verifiable results.



Distributed Verification strengthens trust by allowing verification across organizational, geographical, and technological boundaries without requiring shared runtime state or distributed consensus.



\---



\# Motivation



Many execution environments involve multiple organizations or trust domains.



Examples include:



\* Financial institutions

\* Supply chains

\* Government agencies

\* Healthcare ecosystems

\* Multi-cloud deployments

\* AI agent ecosystems



Execution Trust should not depend on a single verifier.



Independent parties should be able to verify the same execution record and compare results.



\---



\# Goals



\* Support independent verification by multiple parties.

\* Preserve deterministic verification.

\* Avoid shared runtime state.

\* Avoid consensus protocols.

\* Preserve execution record immutability.



\---



\# Non-Goals



This RFC does not define:



\* Blockchain integration.

\* Distributed consensus.

\* Byzantine fault tolerance.

\* Replicated databases.

\* Distributed transaction coordination.



Distributed Verification is verification, not coordination.

Verification     Verification    Verification

&#x20;  Report A         Report B        Report C

```



Each verifier operates independently.



\---



\# Verification Independence



Each Verification Engine:



\* Loads immutable execution records.

\* Loads immutable evidence.

\* Performs deterministic verification.

\* Produces an immutable Verification Report.



Verifiers never communicate during verification.



\---



\# Trust Model



Distributed trust is established when independent verifiers reach equivalent conclusions using the same immutable execution artifacts.



Trust is derived from:



\* Shared evidence

\* Deterministic verification

\* Independent implementations



Not from verifier communication.



\---



\# Verification Inputs



Every verifier consumes:



\* ExecutionTransaction

\* Evidence

\* Cryptographic metadata

\* Verification configuration



Inputs remain immutable.



\---



\# Verification Outputs



Each verifier produces:



\* Verification Report

\* Verification Timestamp

\* Verifier Identifier

\* Supported Specification Version

\* Metadata



Reports remain independent.



\---



\# Determinism



Equivalent inputs SHALL produce equivalent verification outcomes.



Differences in:



\* Programming language

\* Operating system

\* Cloud provider

\* Hardware

\* Database



SHALL NOT affect verification semantics.



\---



\# Verification Comparison



Independent reports MAY be compared.



Comparison may include:



\* Overall Status

\* Individual Verification Results

\* Cryptographic Validation

\* Evidence Completeness

\* Metadata Compatibility



Comparison does not alter either report.



\---



\# Trust Domains



Example:



```text

Organization A

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Verifier A



Organization B

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Verifier B



Organization C

&#x20;       │

&#x20;       ▼

Verifier C

```



Each organization maintains its own verifier.



No shared runtime is required.



\---



\# Runtime Relationship



The Runtime produces execution records.



The Runtime is unaware of how many verifiers exist.



Execution occurs exactly once.



Verification may occur many times.



\---



\# Replay Relationship



Replay reconstructs execution.



Distributed Verification evaluates trust.



Replay and Verification remain independent capabilities.



\---



\# Package Mapping



```text

packages/



verification/

&#x20;   distributed/

&#x20;       VerificationCoordinator.ts

&#x20;       VerificationComparator.ts

&#x20;       VerificationReportSet.ts

```



Distributed Verification extends the Verification package without changing the Core domain model.



\---



\# Compatibility



This RFC is backward compatible.



Single-verifier deployments remain fully supported.



Distributed Verification is an optional capability.



\---



\# Alternatives Considered



\## Blockchain Verification



Rejected because Parmana focuses on independently verifiable execution rather than distributed consensus.



\---



\## Shared Verification Database



Rejected because it creates unnecessary coupling between organizations.



\---



\## Runtime-Based Verification



Rejected because verification must remain independent of execution.



\---



\# Open Questions



\* Should verification reports be digitally signed?

\* Should report comparison become standardized?

\* Should verifier capabilities be discoverable?

\* Should verifier reputation be represented?



\---



\# Acceptance Criteria



\* Multiple Verification Engines can evaluate the same execution record independently.

\* Equivalent inputs produce equivalent verification outcomes.

\* Verification Reports remain immutable.

\* Verification requires no shared runtime state.

\* Distributed Verification introduces no changes to the Core domain model.
