# Contributing to Parmana

## External contributions

This repository is proprietary and source-available for evaluation only (see
[LICENSE](LICENSE)). Pull requests from outside Parmana Systems are not accepted without a
prior written contributor agreement, and will be closed. Questions, feedback and bug reports
are welcome by email at [founder@parmanasystems.com](mailto:founder@parmanasystems.com) or as
a GitHub issue. Report security issues privately, as described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

The rest of this file is the process for people working on Parmana under such an agreement.

Parmana authorizes and evidences what automated systems do, so correctness, determinism and
verifiable evidence come before convenience.

## How a change is made

1. **Its own branch from `main`**, and a pull request. Nothing is pushed to `main` directly.
2. **Tests with the change.** A bug fix adds a test that fails without it; new behavior adds
   tests for it, including the refusal paths.
3. **The full check passes.** The pre commit hook runs gitleaks, typecheck, lint, format, every
   test, the build and the runnable examples; CI runs the same. If it reports stale build
   output, run `npx tsc -b` and commit again.
4. **The records are updated in the same pull request**:
   - [docs/CLAIMS.md](docs/CLAIMS.md) when what Parmana can claim changes. A claim is written
     in the present tense only when code and tests back it.
   - [docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md](docs/VERIFICATION-GAPS.md) when a gap is found or closed.
   - [docs/REMAINING-WORK.md](docs/REMAINING-WORK.md) when open work changes.
   - An ADR in [docs/adr/](docs/adr/) when an architectural decision is made or reversed.
   - The published docs in [docs/site/](docs/site/) when behavior a reader relies on changes,
     and the changelog (`docs/site/changelog.mdx`).

## Principles a change must keep

- The policy decides; nothing executes without an approved decision.
- Fail closed: missing configuration, a failed check or an unavailable dependency refuses,
  never degrades silently.
- Evidence is signed and append only, and can be verified without trusting Parmana.
- Policy evaluation is deterministic.

## Connectors

Read [docs/architecture/CONNECTOR_ISOLATION.md](docs/architecture/CONNECTOR_ISOLATION.md) and
[docs/connectors/BUILDING_A_CONNECTOR.md](docs/connectors/BUILDING_A_CONNECTOR.md) before
adding one. Every connector is registered through the standard path so it gets credential
isolation; a `legacyInsecure: true` registration outside a test is not acceptable.

## Security issues

Report them privately, as described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not in a public issue.
