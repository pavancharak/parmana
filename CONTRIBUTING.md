\# Contributing to Parmana



Thank you for contributing to Parmana.



Parmana is an Execution Trust Infrastructure platform. The project prioritizes correctness, determinism, immutability, and verifiable execution over implementation convenience.



\## Architecture First



Every significant architectural change should begin with documentation.



Use the following decision process:



1\. Is this a bug fix?



&#x20;  \* Implement the fix with tests.



2\. Is this a new feature?



&#x20;  \* Create an RFC describing the proposal.



3\. Does the feature change architectural behavior?



&#x20;  \* Create or update an Architecture Decision Record (ADR).



4\. Does the change modify a normative platform contract?



&#x20;  \* Update the relevant specification in `docs/`.



\## Core Principles



Every contribution should preserve the following principles:



\* Deterministic execution

\* Immutable domain model

\* Independent verification

\* Append-only evidence

\* Cryptographic agility

\* Separation of concerns

\* Execution trust



Changes that violate these principles require an approved ADR.



\## Testing Requirements



All changes should include appropriate automated tests.



At a minimum:



\* Unit tests for new domain behavior.

\* Regression tests for bug fixes.

\* Conformance tests when platform contracts are affected.



The build should pass:



```bash

npm run build

npm run typecheck

npm test

```



\## Coding Standards



\* Use TypeScript strict mode.

\* Prefer immutable objects.

\* Avoid hidden side effects.

\* Keep classes focused on a single responsibility.

\* Document public APIs.



\## Pull Requests



Pull requests should include:



\* A clear description.

\* Linked issue or RFC (if applicable).

\* Updated documentation when required.

\* Passing build and test results.

\## Philosophy



Parmana is designed to establish trust between authority and execution.



Every contribution should strengthen that goal.
