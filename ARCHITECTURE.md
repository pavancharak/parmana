\# Parmana Architecture



\## Execution Trust Infrastructure



\*\*Version:\*\* v1.0 (Architecture)



\---



\# Executive Summary



Parmana is \*\*Execution Trust Infrastructure\*\*.



Traditional systems establish trust by recording who approved an action and when it was approved.



Parmana extends this model by making execution itself verifiable.



It establishes an immutable trust chain between authority, intent, execution, evidence, verification, and cryptographic proof.



The result is an independently verifiable \*\*Execution Trust Record\*\* that provides evidence of what was authorized, what was intended, what actually executed, and whether execution complied with approved policy.



\---



\# Design Goals



Parmana is designed to provide:



\* Deterministic execution

\* Immutable trust artifacts

\* Cryptographic verification

\* Replayable execution

\* Independent auditability

\* Technology-agnostic execution

\* Long-term algorithm agility



\---



\# Core Principle



Execution technology changes.



Trust should not.



Parmana separates execution from trust so that organizations can verify execution regardless of the underlying execution engine.



\---



\# Canonical Trust Model

Execution Trust Record

```



Every artifact is immutable.



Every artifact contributes to the overall trust chain.



\---



\# Canonical Domain Model



The Parmana domain is composed of immutable trust artifacts.



\## Authority



Defines who is permitted to authorize execution.



\---



\## Intent



Defines what is expected to happen.



\---



\## Policy



Defines the governing business rules.



\---



\## Decision



Records the outcome of policy evaluation.



\---



\## Business Transaction



Represents the accepted business request that becomes the root of the execution trust chain.



\---



\## Execution



Records what actually occurred during execution.



\---



\## Verification



Determines whether execution is consistent with the approved intent.



\---



\## Receipt



Provides a cryptographic attestation of successful verification.



\---



\## Execution Trust Record



The immutable aggregation of every artifact generated during execution.



It represents the complete evidence package for a business transaction.



\---



\# Runtime Architecture



The Runtime coordinates execution without embedding business logic.

The Runtime performs orchestration only.



Business rules are implemented inside application services.

\# Security Model



Parmana protects execution integrity through:



\* Immutable domain objects

\* Append-only evidence

\* Cryptographic hashing

\* Digital signatures

\* Replay verification

\* Deterministic execution

\* Independent verification



Trust artifacts are never modified after creation.



Corrections are represented by additional immutable artifacts.

Each stage contributes evidence.



Each stage produces immutable artifacts.

Supported implementations may include:



\* Memory

\* PostgreSQL

\* Supabase

\* Cloud-native databases

\* Custom enterprise adapters



The Runtime remains independent of storage technology.



\---



\# Cryptographic Architecture



Every Execution Trust Record is designed to support:



\* Canonical serialization

\* SHA-256 hashing

\* Digital signatures

\* Cryptographic receipts

\* Independent verification



Future versions will support post-quantum cryptographic algorithms through algorithm agility rather than architectural changes.



\---



\# Extensibility



Execution engines are replaceable.



Examples include:



\* Enterprise software

\* Cloud services

\* AI systems

\* AI agents

\* Multi-agent systems

\* Robotics

\* Distributed systems

\* Edge computing

\* Future quantum computing platforms



Execution technology may evolve without changing the trust model.

\* Immutable by default

\* Deterministic by design

\* Verifiable by evidence

\* Replayable by construction

\* Storage agnostic

\* Execution agnostic

\* Cryptographically verifiable

\* Future-ready through algorithm agility

Execution Trust Record

```



Parmana is designed to remain stable as execution technologies evolve.



Its purpose is not to replace execution systems.



Its purpose is to provide a universal trust layer that allows organizations to verify computational execution across generations of technology.



\---



\# Closing Statement



Parmana establishes a verifiable trust chain between authority, intent, execution, and evidence.



As computing evolves—from enterprise software to AI systems, autonomous agents, robotics, distributed platforms, and future quantum computing—Parmana remains the execution trust layer that enables organizations to prove, independently and cryptographically, that computational systems executed exactly what they were authorized to do.
