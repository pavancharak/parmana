\# Parmana Specification



\*\*Version:\*\* 0.1.0



\*\*Status:\*\* Draft



\---



\# Abstract



Parmana is an \*\*Execution Trust Infrastructure\*\*.



This specification defines the canonical architecture, domain model, execution model, verification model, and platform guarantees required for a conformant implementation.



The specification is implementation independent.



\---



\# Scope



This specification defines:



\* Core Domain Model

\* Runtime Model

\* Verification Model

\* Evidence Model

\* Cryptographic Model

\* Platform Guarantees

\* Conformance Requirements



This specification does not define:



\* Programming languages

\* Databases

\* Network protocols

\* User interfaces

\* Cloud providers



\---



\# Normative Language



The key words:



\* SHALL

\* SHALL NOT

\* SHOULD

\* SHOULD NOT

\* MAY



are to be interpreted as defined in RFC 2119.



\---



\# Execution Trust Model



Execution Trust is established through the following chain:



```text

Authority

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Intent

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Authorization

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Execution

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Evidence

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Verification

&#x20;     │

&#x20;     ▼

Trust

```



Every compliant implementation SHALL preserve this trust chain.



\---



\# Core Concepts



The canonical domain model consists of:



\* Authority

\* Intent

\* Authorization

\* Execution

\* Evidence

\* ExecutionTransaction



ExecutionTransaction is the aggregate root.



\---



\# Runtime Model



Runtime SHALL:



\* Execute deterministic pipelines.

\* Produce immutable execution records.

\* Generate evidence.



Runtime SHALL NOT:



\* Verify execution.

\* Modify historical evidence.



\---



\# Verification Model



Verification SHALL:



\* Operate independently.

\* Consume immutable execution records.

\* Produce deterministic verification reports.



\---



\# Evidence Model



Evidence SHALL:



\* Be immutable.

\* Be append-only.

\* Support replay.

\* Support independent verification.



\---



\# Cryptography



Cryptography SHALL:



\* Be algorithm independent.

\* Support provider substitution.

\* Preserve historical compatibility.



\---



\# Platform Guarantees



Every implementation SHALL provide:



\* Deterministic execution.

\* Immutable records.

\* Independent verification.

\* Replayability.

\* Auditability.

\* Technology independence.



\---



\# Conformance



An implementation is conformant when it satisfies:



\* Core requirements.

\* Runtime requirements.

\* Verification requirements.

\* Platform guarantees.



Conformance SHOULD be demonstrated through automated tests.



\---



\# Versioning



The specification follows Semantic Versioning.



Breaking specification changes require a major version.



\---

\# Relationship to Repository



This specification is supported by:



\* Specifications (`docs/000–017`)

\* ADRs (`docs/adr/`)

\* RFCs (`docs/rfcs/`)

\* Conformance Tests

\* Reference Implementation



The implementation serves as a reference for this specification but does not replace it.



\---



\# Vision



Parmana defines an open architecture for establishing Execution Trust.



Independent implementations that satisfy this specification can interoperate while preserving deterministic execution, immutable evidence, and independently verifiable trust.
